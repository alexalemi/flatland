<h1>FLATLAND</h1>

<h2><a id="part01"></a>PART I<br>
THIS WORLD</h2>
</center>


<h2>Chapter 1: What Flatland Is Like</h2>


<p>
I call our world Flatland, not because that's what we call it, but to help you understand what it's like. You, my lucky readers, live in a 3D world with depth. To understand Flatland, imagine a huge piece of paper. On this paper, imagine shapes like lines, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons. These shapes aren't stuck in one place - they can move around freely on the paper's surface. But here's the catch: they can't move up or down off the paper. They're a bit like shadows, but with hard, glowing edges. That should give you a good idea of what my country and its inhabitants are like.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, I would have said "my universe" instead of "my country." But now my mind has been opened to bigger ideas.
</p>

<p>
In a world like this, you'll quickly realize that we can't have anything truly "solid" like you do. You might think we could at least see the different shapes moving around as I've described. But no, we can't even see that much. All we can see are straight lines. Nothing else is visible to us. I know this sounds strange, but let me explain why.
</p>

<p>
Try this: Put a coin on the middle of a table. Now, look down at it from above. You'll see a circle, right? But now, start to lower your eye level towards the edge of the table. As you do this, you'll notice the coin starts to look more oval-shaped. Keep going until your eye is right at the edge of the table (this is basically how we see in Flatland). At this point, the coin won't look oval anymore – it'll just look like a straight line.
</p>

<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/img01.jpg" />
</figure>
</center>

<p>
The same thing would happen with any shape cut out of cardboard – a triangle, a square, anything. When you look at it with your eye right at the table's edge, it stops looking like a shape and just appears to be a straight line.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a triangle as an example – in our world, this represents a tradesman of respectable class. Figure 1 shows how you'd see the tradesman if you were looking down from above. Figures 2 and 3 show what you'd see if your eye was getting closer to the level of the table. And if your eye was exactly level with the table (which is how we see in Flatland), you'd just see a straight line.
</p>

<p>
I've heard that your sailors have similar experiences when they're at sea and spot a distant island or coast on the horizon. The faraway land might have bays, headlands, and all sorts of angles, but from a distance, you can't see any of that. All you see is a grey, unbroken line on the water.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's exactly what we see when one of our triangular or other-shaped acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland. As they get closer, the line we see gets bigger. As they move away, it gets smaller. But it always looks like a straight line, no matter if it's actually a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, or circle – to us, it's just a straight line.
</p>

<p>
You might be wondering how we can tell each other apart under these circumstances. But don't worry – I'll explain that when I describe the inhabitants of Flatland. For now, let me move on to talk about our climate and houses.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 2: The Weather and Homes in Flatland</h2>

<p>
Just like in your world, we have four main directions: North, South, East, and West.
</p>

<p>
Since we don't have a sun or any other celestial bodies, we can't figure out which way is North in the usual way. But we have our own method. In Flatland, there's a natural, constant pull towards the South. In milder climates, this pull is pretty weak – even a woman in decent health can travel several miles northward without much trouble. But this southward pull, though subtle, is enough to act as a compass in most parts of our world.
</p>

<p>
Also, it helps that the rain (which falls at regular times) always comes from the North. In towns, we can use the houses as guides too. Their side walls usually run North-South, so the roofs can keep off the rain from the North. In the countryside where there aren't any houses, we use tree trunks as a kind of guide. All in all, we don't have as much trouble figuring out our directions as you might think.
</p>

<p>
But in our more temperate regions, where you can barely feel the pull southward, it can be tricky. I've sometimes found myself stuck for hours in a completely empty plain with no houses or trees to guide me, waiting for the rain to start so I could continue my journey. This southward pull is much harder on the weak, elderly, and especially on delicate women. That's why it's considered polite, when you meet a woman on the street, to always give her the North side of the path. This isn't always easy to do quickly when you're in good health and in a climate where it's hard to tell North from South.
</p>

<p>
Our houses don't have windows. Light comes to us the same way whether we're inside or outside, day or night, all the time and everywhere. We don't know where it comes from. In the old days, our scholars used to wonder a lot about "Where does light come from?" Trying to answer this question just led to a lot of people ending up in mental asylums. So, after failed attempts to discourage this research indirectly by taxing it heavily, the government eventually just banned it outright.
</p>

<p>
I – sadly, I alone in Flatland – now know the true answer to this mysterious question. But I can't make any of my countrymen understand my knowledge. They mock me – the only one who knows the truths of Space and the theory of light coming from the world of three dimensions. They treat me like I'm the craziest of the crazy! But let's not dwell on these painful thoughts. Let's get back to talking about our homes.
</p>

<p>
The most common shape for a house is five-sided or pentagonal, as shown in the diagram. The two northern sides, RO and OF, make up the roof, and usually don't have any doors. There's a small door on the East side for women, and a much larger one on the West side for men. The South side, or floor, typically doesn't have a door.
</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>
Square and triangular houses aren't allowed. Here's why: The corners of a square (and even more so of an equilateral triangle) are much sharper than those of a pentagon. Also, the outlines of non-living things (like houses) are harder to see than the outlines of men and women. So there's a real risk that the sharp corners of a square or triangular house could seriously hurt a careless or distracted traveler who might run into them. That's why, as far back as the 11th century of our era, triangular houses were completely banned by law. The only exceptions are fortifications, gunpowder storage, army barracks, and other government buildings that the general public shouldn't approach without being careful.
</p>

<p>
At that time, square houses were still allowed everywhere, though they were discouraged with a special tax. But about three centuries later, the law decided that in all towns with more than 10,000 people, the smallest angle allowed for a house, for public safety reasons, would be that of a pentagon. The good sense of the community has supported the government's efforts. Now, even in the countryside, almost all houses are pentagonal. It's only occasionally, in some really remote and backward farming areas, that you might still find a square house.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 3: The People of Flatland</h2>

<p>
The biggest fully-grown inhabitant of Flatland might measure about eleven of your inches from end to end. Twelve inches would be considered extremely tall.
</p>

<p>
Our women are straight lines.
</p>

<p>
Our soldiers and lowest-class workers are triangles with two equal sides. Each of these sides is about eleven inches long, with a base (the third side) so short (often not even half an inch) that they form a very sharp and dangerous angle at their point. In fact, when their bases are extremely short (not more than an eighth of an inch), you can barely tell them apart from straight lines or women - their points are that sharp. Like in your world, we call these triangles "isosceles," and that's how I'll refer to them from now on.
</p>

<p>
Our middle class consists of equilateral triangles - triangles with all sides equal.
</p>

<p>
Our professionals and gentlemen are squares (which is what I am) and pentagons (five-sided figures).
</p>

<p>
Above these are the nobility, with several ranks starting from hexagons (six-sided figures) and increasing in the number of sides until they earn the respected title of "polygonal" or many-sided. Finally, when a shape has so many sides that you can't distinguish it from a circle, it's considered part of the circular or priestly order - the highest class of all.
</p>

<p>
In our society, it's a law of nature that a male child will have one more side than his father. So, each generation usually moves up one step in social status and nobility. For example, the son of a square is a pentagon, the son of a pentagon is a hexagon, and so on.
</p>

<p>
But this rule doesn't always apply to tradesmen, and even less to soldiers and workers. These lower classes can hardly be called human figures at all, since their sides aren't all equal. For them, nature's law doesn't hold, and the son of an isosceles (a triangle with two equal sides) usually remains an isosceles.
</p>

<p>
However, there's still hope for the isosceles class. After a long string of military victories or hard, skilled labor, the smarter ones among the artisan and soldier classes might develop a slightly longer third side (or base) and their other two sides might shrink a bit. Marriages (arranged by priests) between the sons and daughters of these more intelligent lower-class members often result in children that are closer to being equilateral triangles.
</p>

<p>
It's rare - compared to the huge number of isosceles births - for a true, certified equilateral triangle to be born to isosceles parents.<sup>[1]</sup>  This kind of birth requires not only a series of carefully planned marriages but also long-term self-control and moderation by the would-be ancestors, and a patient, systematic development of the isosceles intellect over many generations.
</p>

<p class="footnote" id="foot1">
[1]: "Why do you need a certificate?" a critic from Spaceland might ask. "Isn't the birth of a Square son natural proof that the father is Equal-sided?" My answer is that no respectable woman will marry a Triangle without certification. Occasionally, a slightly Irregular Triangle has produced Square offspring, but in almost every such case, the irregularity of the first generation affects the third generation. Either they fail to achieve Pentagon status or they revert back to being Triangular.
</p>

<p>
When a true equilateral triangle is born to isosceles parents, it's cause for celebration for miles around. After a thorough examination by the Health and Social Services Board, if the infant is certified as regular, it's officially admitted into the equilateral class in a solemn ceremony. The baby is then taken from its proud but sad parents and adopted by a childless equilateral couple. The adoptive parents must swear never to let the child enter its former home or even look at its birth family again. This is to prevent the newly developed shape from unconsciously imitating its family and sliding back to its hereditary level.
</p>

<p>
The occasional emergence of an equilateral from lower-class ancestors is welcomed not only by the poor lower classes themselves, as a glimmer of hope in their monotonous lives, but also by the upper classes. The higher classes know that while these rare cases don't really threaten their own privileges, they serve as a useful barrier against revolution from below.
</p>

<p>
If the sharp-angled lower classes had no hope or ambition at all, they might have found leaders in their many rebellions who were smart enough to make their superior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the circles to handle. But nature has wisely decreed that as the working classes become more intelligent and virtuous, their sharp angles (which make them physically dangerous) also increase and become more like the relatively harmless angle of an equilateral triangle. Even in the most brutal and formidable soldier class - creatures almost as unintelligent as women - we find that as they develop the mental ability to use their tremendous piercing power effectively, they lose some of that piercing power itself.
</p>

<p>
How wonderful is this law of compensation! It perfectly proves the natural fitness and, I might even say, the divine origin of the aristocratic constitution of Flatland! By cleverly using this law of nature, the polygons and circles can almost always stop rebellion in its earliest stages. They take advantage of the irrepressible hopefulness of the human mind. Through art and science, they can often make some of the more intelligent rebel leaders perfectly regular, admitting them immediately into the privileged classes. A much larger number, who are still below standard, are tempted by the prospect of eventually being ennobled and are persuaded to enter state hospitals, where they're kept in comfortable confinement for life. Only one or two of the most stubborn, foolish, and hopelessly irregular are executed.
</p>

<p>
Then the miserable masses of isosceles, without plans or leaders, are either quickly defeated by the small group of their brothers that the Chief Circle keeps on standby for emergencies, or more often, they're manipulated by the circular party into fighting among themselves, destroying each other with their own angles. Our history records no less than 120 rebellions, not counting smaller uprisings numbered at 235, and they've all ended this way.
</p>



<h2>Chapter 4: About the Women</h2>

<p>
If you think our very pointy triangles of the soldier class are dangerous, you can imagine how much more dangerous our women are. If a soldier is like a wedge, a woman is like a needle - she's all point, at least at her two ends. Add to this the fact that she can make herself practically invisible at will, and you'll understand why a female in Flatland is not someone to be taken lightly.
</p>

<p>
But here, some of my younger readers might ask, "How can a woman in Flatland make herself invisible?" This should be obvious without explanation. But let me clarify it for you.
</p>

<p>
Place a needle on a table. Now, look at it from the side, with your eye level with the table. You can see its whole length, right? But look at it end-on, and you see nothing but a point - it's become practically invisible. It's the same with our women. When her side is facing us, we see her as a straight line. When the end containing her eye or mouth (for us, these two organs are the same) is facing us, we see nothing but a very bright point. But when her back is towards us, since it's not as shiny and is almost as dim as an inanimate object, it acts like an Invisible Cap.
</p>

<p>
Now you can see the dangers we face from our women. If even the angle of a respectable middle-class triangle isn't without its dangers, if bumping into a working man can cause a gash, if a collision with a military officer can result in a serious wound, if just a touch from the point of a common soldier can be fatal - what do you think would happen if you ran into a woman? It would be nothing short of instant destruction. And when a woman is invisible, or visible only as a dim, faint point, how hard must it be, even for the most careful, to always avoid colliding with her?
</p>

<p>
Many laws have been made at different times in different states of Flatland to minimize this danger. In the southern, hotter climates, where gravity is stronger and people are more likely to move around accidentally, the laws about women are naturally much stricter. But you can get a general idea of the rules from this summary:
</p>

<p>
1. Every house must have one entrance on the east side, for women only. All females must enter "in a proper and respectful manner"<sup>[2]</sup> through this door, not through the men's or western door.
</p>

<p class="footnote" id="foot2">
[2]: When I was in Spaceland, I learned that some of your religious leaders have a similar setup. They have separate entrances for villagers, farmers, and public school teachers (as reported in The Spectator, September 1884, p. 1255). This is so these people can "approach in a proper and respectful way."
</p>

<p>
2. No female can walk in any public place without constantly making a peace-cry, under penalty of death.
</p>

<p>
3. Any female certified to be suffering from St. Vitus's Dance, fits, chronic cold with violent sneezing, or any disease causing involuntary movements, must be immediately destroyed.
</p>

<p>
In some states, there's an additional law that forbids females, under penalty of death, from standing or walking in any public place without moving their backs constantly from right to left to show their presence to those behind them. Other states require a woman, when traveling, to be followed by one of her sons, servants, or her husband. Some states even confine women to their houses except during religious festivals. But the wisest of our leaders have found that increasing restrictions on females not only weakens and reduces the population but also leads to more domestic murders, to the point where a state loses more than it gains from too many rules.
</p>

<p>
Whenever women's tempers are aggravated by being confined at home or by too many rules when they're out, they tend to take out their anger on their husbands and children. In the hotter climates, the entire male population of a village has sometimes been wiped out in just an hour or two during a simultaneous female outburst. So, the three laws mentioned above are enough for the better-governed states and can be seen as a rough example of our Female Code.
</p>

<p>
After all, our main protection comes not from laws but from the interests of the women themselves. Although they can cause instant death with a backward movement, if they can't quickly disengage their stinging end from their victim's struggling body, their own fragile bodies are likely to be shattered.
</p>

<p>
Fashion is also on our side. I mentioned earlier that in some less civilized states, no female is allowed to stand in any public place without swaying her back from right to left. This practice has been universal among well-bred ladies in all well-governed states for as long as anyone can remember. It's considered a disgrace to any state if they have to enforce by law what should be, and is in every respectable female, a natural instinct. The rhythmic and, if I may say so, well-modulated swaying of the back in our circular-rank ladies is envied and imitated by the wife of a common equilateral, who can only manage a monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum. And the regular tick of the equilateral is just as admired and copied by the wife of the progressive and ambitious isosceles, in whose family no "back-motion" of any kind has yet become necessary for life. So, in every family of status and importance, "back-motion" is as common as time itself, and the husbands and sons in these households are at least safe from invisible attacks.
</p>

<p>
Not that you should think for a moment that our women are without affection. But unfortunately, in the weaker sex, the passion of the moment tends to overrule every other consideration. This is, of course, a necessity arising from their unfortunate shape. Since they have no angles at all, being even lower in this respect than the lowest isosceles, they are completely devoid of brainpower and have no ability to think, judge, or plan ahead, and hardly any memory. So in their fits of fury, they forget all claims and recognize no distinctions. I've actually known a case where a woman wiped out her entire household, and half an hour later, when her rage was over and the remains had been cleared away, she asked what had happened to her husband and children.
</p>

<p>
Obviously then, a woman should not be irritated as long as she's in a position where she can turn around. When you have them in their apartments - which are designed to prevent them from turning - you can say and do what you like. They're then completely harmless, and a few minutes later, they won't remember the incident for which they might have been threatening you with death just moments ago, nor the promises you might have had to make to calm them down.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, we get along pretty smoothly in our domestic relationships, except in the lower levels of the military classes. There, the lack of tact and discretion on the part of the husbands sometimes leads to indescribable disasters. Relying too much on the offensive weapons of their sharp angles instead of using good sense and timely pretense, these reckless creatures often neglect to build their wives' apartments properly, or they irritate their wives with ill-advised words outside and then refuse to take them back. Moreover, a blunt and stubborn regard for literal truth makes them unwilling to make the lavish promises that a more sensible circle can use to instantly pacify his wife. The result is massacre, though not without its advantages, as it eliminates the more brutal and troublesome of the isosceles. Many of our circles see the destructiveness of the thinner sex as one of many providential arrangements for controlling excess population and nipping revolution in the bud.
</p>

<p>
Yet even in our best-regulated and most nearly circular families, I can't say that the ideal of family life is as high as it is in your Spaceland. There is peace, in the sense that there's no slaughter, but there's necessarily little harmony in tastes or pursuits. The cautious wisdom of the circles has ensured safety at the cost of domestic comfort. In every circular or polygonal household, it has been a habit from time immemorial - and now has become a kind of instinct among the women of our higher classes - that the mothers and daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths towards their husband and his male friends. For a lady in a distinguished family to turn her back on her husband would be seen as a kind of omen, involving loss of status. But, as I'll soon show, this custom, though it has the advantage of safety, is not without its downsides.
</p>

<p>
In the house of the working man or respectable tradesman - where the wife is allowed to turn her back on her husband while doing her household chores - there are at least moments of quiet, when the wife is neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound of the continuous peace-cry. But in the homes of the upper classes, there is often no peace at all. There, the chattering mouth and bright, piercing eye are always directed towards the master of the household, and light itself is not more persistent than the stream of female conversation. The tact and skill that are enough to avoid a woman's sting are not enough to stop a woman's mouth. And since the wife has absolutely nothing to say, and absolutely no constraint of wit, sense, or conscience to prevent her from saying it, quite a few cynics have said that they prefer the danger of the deadly but silent sting to the safe but constant chatter from a woman's other end.
</p>

<p>
To my Spaceland readers, the condition of our women may seem truly pitiful, and so indeed it is. A male of the lowest type of isosceles may hope for some improvement of his angle and the eventual elevation of his whole degraded class, but no woman can entertain such hopes for her sex. "Once a woman, always a woman" is a decree of nature, and even the laws of evolution seem suspended in her disfavor. Yet at least we can admire the wise arrangement which has ordained that, as they have no hopes, so they shall have no memory to recall, and no foresight to anticipate, the miseries and humiliations which are at once a necessity of their existence and the basis of the constitution of Flatland.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 5: How We Recognize Each Other</h2>

<p>
You, who are blessed with both shade and light, who have two eyes and understand perspective, who can enjoy various colors, who can actually see an angle and view the complete circumference of a circle in your happy three-dimensional world - how can I make you understand the extreme difficulty we face in Flatland when it comes to recognizing each other?
</p>

<p>
Remember what I told you earlier: All beings in Flatland, living or not, no matter what their shape, appear to us as straight lines. How then can we tell one figure from another, when they all look the same?
</p>

<p>
The answer is threefold. The first method of recognition is hearing, which for us is much more developed than it is for you. It allows us not only to distinguish our personal friends by their voices but even to tell different classes apart, at least for the three lowest orders: the equilateral, the square, and the pentagon. (I'm not counting the isosceles here.) But as we move up the social ladder, the process of distinguishing by voice becomes more difficult, partly because voices become more similar, and partly because the ability to distinguish voices is considered a common skill, not much valued by the aristocracy. And whenever there's any risk of imposture, we can't rely on this method. Among our lowest classes, the vocal organs are developed to a degree that's more than matched by their hearing ability, so an isosceles can easily imitate the voice of a polygon, and with some training, even that of a circle. So a second method is more commonly used.
</p>

<p>
Feeling is the main way of recognition among our women and lower classes - I'll talk about our upper classes later - especially between strangers, and when the question is about class rather than individual identity. What "introduction" means among the higher classes in Spaceland, the process of "feeling" is for us. "Allow me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr. So-and-so" is still the usual way of introduction among the more old-fashioned country gentlemen in remote areas. But in towns and among businessmen, the words "be felt by" are left out, and the sentence is shortened to, "Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so," although it's assumed, of course, that the "feeling" will be mutual. Among our more modern and dashing young gentlemen - who are extremely averse to unnecessary effort and supremely indifferent to the purity of our language - the phrase is further shortened by using "to feel" in a technical sense, meaning "to recommend for the purposes of feeling and being felt." At this moment, the slang of polite or fast society in the upper classes allows such a barbarism as "Mr. Smith, let me feel Mr. Jones."
</p>

<p>
Don't think, however, that "feeling" is as tedious a process for us as it would be for you, or that we need to feel all around every individual before we can determine their class. Long practice and training, starting in schools and continuing through daily life, enable us to distinguish immediately by touch between the angles of an equilateral triangle, a square, and a pentagon. And I hardly need to say that the brainless point of a sharp-angled isosceles is obvious even to the dullest touch. So it's usually not necessary to do more than feel a single angle of an individual; once this is done, we know the class of the person we're addressing, unless they belong to the higher sections of the nobility. There, the difficulty is much greater. Even a Master of Arts from our University of Wentbridge has been known to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided polygon, and there's hardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous university who could quickly and confidently distinguish between a twenty-sided and a twenty-four-sided member of the aristocracy.
</p>

<p>
Those of my readers who recall the extracts I gave earlier from the legislative code concerning women will easily understand that the process of introduction by contact requires some care and discretion. Otherwise, the angles might inflict irreparable injury on the unwary person doing the feeling. It's essential for the safety of the feeler that the person being felt should stand perfectly still. A sudden start, a fidgety change of position, or even a violent sneeze has been known to prove fatal to the careless and to nip many a promising friendship in the bud. This is especially true among the lower classes of triangles. With them, the eye is located so far from their vertex that they can hardly notice what's happening at that end of their body. Moreover, they're of a rough, coarse nature, not sensitive to the delicate touch of the highly organized polygon. So it's no wonder that an involuntary toss of the head has sometimes deprived the state of a valuable life!
</p>

<p>
I've heard that my excellent grandfather - one of the least irregular of his unhappy isosceles class, who indeed obtained, shortly before his death, four out of seven votes from the Sanitary and Social Board for passing him into the equal-sided class - often spoke tearfully of an accident of this kind that happened to his great-great-great-grandfather, a respectable working man with a brain angle of 59°30'. According to his story, my unfortunate ancestor, suffering from rheumatism and in the act of being felt by a polygon, accidentally stabbed the great man with a sudden start, partly through his diagonal. This incident, combined with his long imprisonment and degradation, and partly because of the moral shock that affected all of my ancestor's relations, set our family back a degree and a half in their climb towards better things. As a result, in the next generation, the family brain was registered at only 58°, and it took five generations to recover the lost ground, reach the full 60°, and finally achieve the rise from the isosceles class.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I think I hear some of my better-educated readers exclaim, "How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and degrees or minutes? We can see an angle because we can see two straight lines meeting, but you, who can only see one straight line at a time, or at most a number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line - how can you ever recognize an angle, let alone measure angles of different sizes?"
</p>

<p>
I answer that though we can't see angles, we can infer them, and with great precision. Our sense of touch, sharpened by necessity and developed through long training, allows us to distinguish angles far more accurately than your sense of sight can, without the help of a ruler or protractor. Nor should I forget to explain that we have great natural aids. It's a law of nature for us that the brain of the isosceles class begins at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and increases (if it increases at all) by half a degree in each generation until the goal of 60° is reached. At this point, the condition of serfdom is left behind, and the freeman enters the class of regulars.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, nature itself provides us with an ascending scale or alphabet of angles from half a degree up to 60°, examples of which are placed in every elementary school throughout the land. Due to occasional setbacks, even more frequent moral and intellectual stagnation, and the extraordinary fertility of the criminal and vagrant classes, there's always a vast surplus of individuals of the half-degree and single-degree class, and a fair abundance of specimens up to 10°. These are completely lacking in civil rights, and a great number of them, not even having enough intelligence for warfare, are devoted by the states to the service of education. Chained immovably to remove all possibility of danger, they're placed in the classrooms of our infant schools, where they're used by the Board of Education to teach tact and intelligence to the offspring of the middle classes - qualities that these wretched creatures themselves completely lack.
</p>

<p>
In some states, the specimens are occasionally fed and allowed to live for several years. But in the more temperate and better-regulated regions, it's found in the long run to be more advantageous for the educational interests of the young to do without food and to renew the specimens every month - which is about the average lifespan of the foodless criminal class. In the cheaper schools, what's gained by the longer existence of the specimen is lost, partly in the cost of food, and partly in the reduced accuracy of the angles, which deteriorate after a few weeks of constant "feeling." We shouldn't forget to add, when listing the advantages of the more expensive system, that it tends, though slightly but noticeably, to reduce the surplus isosceles population - a goal that every statesman in Flatland constantly keeps in mind. On the whole, therefore - although I'm not unaware that in many popularly elected school boards, there's a reaction in favor of what's called "the cheap system" - I'm inclined to think that this is one of the many cases where expense is the truest economy.
</p>

<p>
But I mustn't allow questions of school board politics to distract me from my subject. Enough has been said, I trust, to show that recognition by feeling is not as tedious or uncertain a process as might have been thought, and it's obviously more reliable than recognition by hearing. Still, as has been pointed out above, the objection remains that this method is not without danger. For this reason, many in the middle and lower classes, and all without exception in the polygonal and circular orders, prefer a third method, which I'll describe in the next section.
</p>



<h2>Chapter 6: How We Recognize Each Other by Sight</h2>

<p>
I know I might sound inconsistent here. In earlier sections, I said that all figures in Flatland look like straight lines, and I implied that it's impossible to visually tell different classes apart. But now I'm going to explain how we can recognize each other by sight. 
</p>

<p>
If you look back, though, you'll see that I said this kind of recognition is only "universal among the lower classes." It's only in the higher classes and in our milder climates that we use sight recognition.
</p>

<p>
The reason we can do this at all is because of fog. In your world, fog is just an annoyance that blocks the view and makes people gloomy. But for us, it's almost as important as air. We see it as the source of arts and the parent of sciences. Let me explain what I mean.
</p>

<p>
If there was no fog, all lines would look equally clear, no matter how far away they were. This is actually the case in those unlucky countries where the air is perfectly dry and clear. But where there's a good amount of fog, objects that are further away look dimmer than those that are closer. Even a difference of a few inches can be noticeable. By carefully observing these differences in brightness, we can figure out the shape of what we're looking at.
</p>

<p>
Let me give you an example to make this clearer.
</p>

<p>
Suppose I see two individuals approaching and I want to figure out their rank. Let's say they're a Merchant and a Physician - in other words, an Equilateral Triangle and a Pentagon. How can I tell them apart?
</p>

<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/img03.jpg" />
</figure>
</center>

<p>
Any child in Spaceland who's studied a bit of geometry would understand that if I can position my eye so that it bisects an angle of the approaching stranger, my view will be evenly between the two sides closest to me. This way, both sides will appear the same size to me.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the case of the Merchant (the Triangle), what will I see? I'll see a straight line DAE, where the middle point (A) will be very bright because it's closest to me. But on either side, the line will quickly fade into dimness, because the sides AC and AB quickly recede into the fog. The Merchant's extremities, D and E, will be very dim indeed.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, with the Physician (the Pentagon), I'll also see a line (D'A'E') with a bright center (A'). But it will fade away less quickly, because its sides (A'C', A'B') don't recede into the fog as rapidly. The Physician's extremities, D' and E', won't be as dim as the Merchant's.
</p>

<p>
From these two examples, you can probably understand how - after a lot of training and constant practice - the well-educated classes among us can fairly accurately tell the difference between the middle and lower orders by sight. If my Spaceland readers can grasp this general idea and see how it might be possible, I've achieved all I can reasonably expect.
</p>

<p>
If I tried to give more details, I'd probably just confuse you. But for the sake of young and inexperienced readers, who might think from my simple examples of recognizing my Father and Sons that sight recognition is easy, I should point out that in real life, most recognition problems are much more subtle and complex.
</p>

<p>
For example, if my Father (a Triangle) approaches me sideways instead of point-first, I might not be sure at first if he's a Triangle or a straight line (in other words, a Woman). I'd have to ask him to rotate or I'd have to move my eye around him to be sure.
</p>

<p>
Or if I'm with one of my hexagonal Grandsons and I'm looking straight at one of his sides, I'll see one whole line (AB) that's quite bright (barely fading at the ends) and two smaller lines (CA and BD) that are dim throughout and fade away towards the ends C and D.
</p>

<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/img04.jpg" />
</figure>
</center>

<p>
But I shouldn't go into too much detail on this. Even the least skilled mathematician in Spaceland will believe me when I say that the problems of life become very complex for well-educated Flatlanders when they're in motion - rotating, advancing, or retreating - and trying to distinguish between several high-ranking Polygons moving in different directions. Imagine trying to do this at a ball or a party! These challenges fully justify the extensive education of our Learned Professors of Geometry, both Static and Kinetic, at the great University of Wentbridge, where Sight Recognition is taught as both a science and an art to large classes of the elite of the States.
</p>

<p>
Only a few of the sons from our noblest and wealthiest houses can afford the time and money needed to fully master this great and valuable Art. Even for me, a Mathematician of some standing and the Grandfather of two promising young Hexagons, it can be very confusing to find myself in the middle of a crowd of rotating Polygons of the higher classes. And of course, for a common Tradesman or Serf, such a sight would be almost as incomprehensible as it would be for you if you were suddenly transported to my country.
</p>

<p>
In such a crowd, all you would see around you is a Line, seemingly straight, but with parts that constantly change in brightness. Even if you had completed your third year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes at the University, and were perfect in the theory, you'd still need many years of experience before you could move in a fashionable crowd without bumping into your betters. It's against etiquette to ask them to "feel" you, and they, with their superior culture and breeding, know all about your movements, while you know very little or nothing about theirs. In short, to behave perfectly in Polygonal society, you really need to be a Polygon yourself. At least, that's what my painful experience has taught me.
</p>

<p>
It's amazing how much the Art - or I might almost call it instinct - of Sight Recognition develops with regular practice and by avoiding the habit of "Feeling." It's like how, in your world, deaf and mute people who are allowed to use gestures and hand-alphabet never really learn the more difficult but far more valuable arts of lip-speech and lip-reading. It's the same with us when it comes to "Seeing" and "Feeling." Anyone who relies on "Feeling" in early life will never truly master "Seeing."
</p>

<p>
For this reason, among our Higher Classes, "Feeling" is discouraged or completely forbidden. From the cradle, their children are sent to higher, exclusive schools instead of the public elementary schools where the art of Feeling is taught. At our prestigious University, "feeling" is seen as a serious offense, resulting in expulsion for a second incident.
</p>

<p>
But among the lower classes, the art of Sight Recognition is seen as an unattainable luxury. A common Tradesman can't afford to let his son spend a third of his life in abstract studies. So the children of the poor are allowed to "feel" from their earliest years. This gives them an early cleverness and liveliness that at first seems to compare favorably with the inactive, undeveloped, and listless behavior of the half-educated youths of the Polygonal class. But when these Polygonal youths finally complete their University course and are ready to put their theory into practice, the change in them is almost like a new birth. In every art, science, and social pursuit, they quickly catch up to and surpass their Triangular competitors.
</p>

<p>
Only a small minority of the Polygonal Class fail to pass the Final Test or Leaving Examination at the University. The condition of this unsuccessful minority is truly pitiful. Rejected by the higher class, they're also looked down upon by the lower. They don't have the mature and systematically trained powers of the Polygonal Bachelors and Masters of Arts, nor do they have the native quick-wittedness and versatility of the young Tradesmen. The professions and public services are closed to them, and although in most States they're not actually barred from marriage, they have the greatest difficulty in forming suitable alliances. Their offspring is generally unfortunate, if not downright Irregular.
</p>

<p>
It's from these unsuccessful members of our Nobility that the great Tumults and Seditions of past ages have usually gotten their leaders. The damage caused by this has been so great that an increasing minority of our more progressive Statesmen believe that true mercy would require completely suppressing them. They argue that all those who fail to pass the Final Examination of the University should either be imprisoned for life or humanely put to death.
</p>

<p>
But I find I've wandered off topic into the subject of Irregularities, a matter of such vital interest that it deserves its own separate section.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 7: About Irregular Shapes</h2>

<p>
Throughout the previous pages, I've been assuming something that perhaps should have been clearly stated at the beginning as a fundamental principle: every human being in Flatland is a Regular Figure. By this, I mean that a Woman must not only be a line, but a perfectly straight line; an Artisan or Soldier must have two equal sides; Tradesmen must have three equal sides; Lawyers (like myself) must have four equal sides, and generally, all Polygons must have all their sides equal.
</p>

<p>
The size of the sides would, of course, depend on the individual's age. A newborn Female would be about an inch long, while a tall adult Woman might be up to a foot long. As for Males of every class, you could roughly say that the total length of an adult's sides is two feet or a little more. But we're not concerned about the size of our sides here. I'm talking about the equality of sides, and it doesn't take much thought to see that our entire social life in Flatland is based on the fundamental fact that Nature intends all Figures to have equal sides.
</p>

<p>
If our sides were unequal, our angles might be unequal too. Instead of being able to determine someone's shape by feeling or seeing just one angle, we'd have to check each angle by Feeling. But life would be too short for such tedious groping. The whole science and art of Sight Recognition would immediately die out; Feeling, as an art, wouldn't survive much longer; social interactions would become dangerous or impossible; there would be no more confidence or foresight; in short, civilization might relapse into barbarism.
</p>

<p>
Am I going too fast for my Readers to follow these obvious conclusions? Surely a moment's reflection and a single example from everyday life must convince everyone that our social system is based on Regularity, or Equality of Angles. For instance, you might meet two or three Tradesmen in the street, whom you immediately recognize as Tradesmen by glancing at their angles and quickly fading sides. You invite them into your house for lunch. You do this confidently because everyone knows to within an inch or two the area occupied by an adult Triangle. But imagine if your Tradesman dragged behind his respectable and regular vertex a parallelogram twelve or thirteen inches long - what would you do with such a monster stuck in your house door?
</p>

<p>
But I'm insulting the intelligence of my Readers by piling up details that must be obvious to anyone who enjoys living in Spaceland. Clearly, measuring a single angle would no longer be enough in such bizarre circumstances; you'd spend your whole life feeling or surveying the perimeter of your acquaintances. The difficulties of avoiding collisions in a crowd are already enough to tax the wisdom of even a well-educated Square; but if no one could calculate the Regularity of a single figure in the group, everything would be chaos and confusion. The slightest panic could cause serious injuries, or if there happened to be any Women or Soldiers present, perhaps considerable loss of life.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, both practical necessity and Nature approve of Regularity in shape. "Irregularity of Figure" means the same to us as, or even more than, a combination of moral wrongness and criminality does to you, and we treat it accordingly. There are some people who argue that there's no necessary connection between geometric and moral Irregularity. They say, "The Irregular are rejected by their own parents from birth, mocked by their siblings, ignored by servants, scorned and suspected by society, and excluded from all positions of responsibility, trust, and useful activity. Their every movement is closely watched by the police until they come of age and present themselves for inspection. Then they're either destroyed if they're found to exceed the allowed margin of deviation, or given an uninteresting job for a miserable wage. They're forced to live and eat at the office, and even take their vacation under close supervision. Is it any wonder that human nature, even in the best and purest, becomes bitter and twisted in such an environment?"
</p>

<p>
All this very plausible reasoning doesn't convince me, just as it hasn't convinced the wisest of our Statesmen, that our ancestors were wrong in establishing the principle that tolerating Irregularity is incompatible with the safety of the State. Undoubtedly, the life of an Irregular is hard; but the interests of the Many require that it should be hard. If a man with a triangular front and a polygonal back were allowed to exist and have children who were even more Irregular, what would become of the arts of life? Would the houses and doors and churches in Flatland have to be altered to accommodate such monsters? Would our ticket collectors have to measure every man's perimeter before allowing him into a theater or lecture room? Should an Irregular be exempted from military service? And if not, how could we prevent him from causing havoc in the ranks of his comrades? Again, what irresistible temptations to fraudulent impostures such a creature would face! How easy it would be for him to enter a shop with his polygonal front first, and order goods to any extent from a trusting tradesman! Let the advocates of a falsely called Philanthropy plead as they may for the abolition of the Irregular Penal Laws, I for one have never known an Irregular who wasn't also what Nature clearly intended him to be - a hypocrite, a misanthrope, and, to the extent of his power, a troublemaker.
</p>

<p>
Not that I would recommend (at present) the extreme measures adopted by some States, where an infant whose angle deviates by half a degree from the correct angle is immediately destroyed at birth. Some of our highest and most capable men, men of real genius, have during their earliest days suffered from deviations as great as, or even greater than, forty-five minutes: and the loss of their valuable lives would have been an irreparable injury to the State. The art of healing has also achieved some of its most glorious triumphs in the compressions, extensions, trepannings, colligations, and other surgical or dietary operations by which Irregularity has been partly or wholly cured. Advocating therefore a middle path, I would not lay down any fixed or absolute line of demarcation; but at the period when the frame is just beginning to set, and when the Medical Board has reported that recovery is improbable, I would suggest that the Irregular offspring be painlessly and mercifully put to death.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 8: The Old Custom of Painting</h2>

<p>
If you've been following me closely up to this point, you won't be surprised to hear that life in Flatland can be pretty dull. Now, I don't mean that we don't have battles, conspiracies, uprisings, factions, and all those other things that are supposed to make history interesting. And I'm not saying that the strange mix of life's problems and math problems, which constantly makes us guess and lets us check our guesses right away, doesn't add a zest to our existence that you in Spaceland might not understand. What I'm talking about now is the aesthetic and artistic side of life. From that point of view, our life is dull - really, really dull.
</p>

<p>
How could it be otherwise? All our scenery, all our historical paintings, all our portraits, flowers, still life - everything we see is just a single line. The only variety we get is in how bright or dark that line is.
</p>

<p>
But it wasn't always like this. If tradition tells the truth, color brought a brief period of splendor to the lives of our ancestors for about half a dozen centuries or so, a very long time ago.
</p>

<p>
The story goes that a private individual - a Pentagon, though reports vary on the exact name - accidentally discovered what makes up the simpler colors and figured out a basic way of painting. They say he started by decorating his house, then his slaves, then his father, his sons and grandsons, and finally himself. The results were both convenient and beautiful, and everyone liked them. Wherever this person (let's call him Chromatistes, which is the name most trusted sources agree on) went with his colorful body, he immediately attracted attention and respect. Nobody needed to "feel" him anymore; no one mistook his front for his back; everyone could easily tell which way he was moving without having to calculate anything; nobody bumped into him or failed to make way for him; he didn't have to strain his voice shouting to announce who he was, like we colorless Squares and Pentagons often have to do when we're in a crowd.
</p>

<p>
The fashion spread like wildfire. Within a week, every Square and Triangle in the district had copied Chromatistes' example. Only a few of the more conservative Pentagons still held out. A month or two later, even the Dodecagons had caught the bug. Before a year had passed, the habit had spread to everyone except the very highest of the Nobility.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, it wasn't long before the custom made its way from Chromatistes' district to surrounding regions. Within two generations, everyone in all of Flatland was colorful - except for the Women and the Priests.
</p>

<p>
Here, Nature herself seemed to put up a barrier and argue against extending this innovation to these two classes. The argument went like this: "Having many sides is meant to imply having many colors." This catchy phrase flew from mouth to mouth, converting whole towns to the new culture at once. But obviously, this saying didn't apply to our Priests and Women. Women only have one side (or, to be pedantic, no sides at all). As for the Priests, if they truly wanted to be seen as perfect Circles and not just very high-class Polygons with an infinite number of infinitesimally small sides, they had to boast (as Women admitted and regretted) that they too had no sides, being blessed with a perimeter of just one line - in other words, a Circumference. So it happened that these two Classes couldn't see any logic in the so-called rule about "Having many sides means having many colors." When everyone else had given in to the temptation of body decoration, only the Priests and Women remained pure and unpainted.
</p>

<p>
Call them immoral, wild, anarchic, unscientific - use whatever names you want - but from an artistic point of view, those ancient days of the Color Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland. Sadly, it was a childhood that never grew into adulthood or even reached its teenage years. Back then, just living was a joy because living meant seeing. Even a small party was a visual treat. The richly varied colors of a crowd in a church or theater are said to have sometimes been too distracting even for our greatest teachers and actors. But the most breathtaking sight of all is said to have been the indescribable magnificence of a military review.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the sight of a battle line of twenty thousand Isosceles soldiers suddenly turning around, switching from the somber black of their bases to the orange of their two sides including their sharp angle. Picture the militia of Equilateral Triangles in red, white, and blue; the artillery-men Squares in mauve, ultramarine, gamboge, and burnt umber, rapidly spinning near their crimson guns; the dashing and flashing of the five-colored and six-colored Pentagons and Hexagons racing across the field as surgeons, geometers, and aides-de-camp. All of this was surely enough to make believable the famous story of how an illustrious Circle, overcome by the artistic beauty of the forces under his command, threw aside his marshal's baton and his royal crown, declaring that from then on, he would exchange them for an artist's brush.
</p>

<p>
The sensory richness of those days must have been incredible. We can see hints of it even in the language and vocabulary of the time. The everyday speech of ordinary citizens during the Color Revolt seems to have been infused with richer tones of word and thought. We still owe our finest poetry and whatever rhythm remains in our more scientific speech to that era.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 9: The Universal Color Bill</h2>

<p>
While all this was happening, the intellectual arts were rapidly declining.
</p>

<p>
The Art of Sight Recognition, no longer necessary, fell out of practice. Studies like Geometry, Statics, Kinetics, and other related subjects soon came to be seen as unnecessary and fell into disrespect and neglect, even at our University. The simpler Art of Feeling quickly met the same fate in our Elementary Schools. 
</p>

<p>
Then the Isosceles classes (lower-class triangles) started causing trouble. They claimed that the Specimens (used for teaching Feeling) were no longer needed, and they refused to pay the usual taxes from the Criminal classes for Education. They grew more numerous and more insolent every day, emboldened by their immunity from the old burden that used to both tame their brutal nature and keep their numbers in check.
</p>

<p>
Year after year, the Soldiers and Artisans began to argue more forcefully - and with increasing truth - that there wasn't much difference between them and the very highest class of Polygons. Now that they were considered equal to the higher classes and could handle all of life's problems, whether they involved movement or not, simply by recognizing colors, they felt they were just as good. They weren't content with the natural decline of Sight Recognition. They boldly demanded that the law prohibit all "monopolizing and aristocratic Arts" and consequently abolish all funding for studies in Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling. Soon, they began to insist that since Color, which they saw as a second Nature, had eliminated the need for aristocratic distinctions, the Law should follow suit. They demanded that from now on, all individuals and all classes should be recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights.
</p>

<p>
Finding the higher Orders wavering and undecided, the leaders of the Revolution pushed their demands even further. They finally insisted that all classes, including the Priests and the Women, should honor Color by allowing themselves to be painted. When it was objected that Priests and Women had no sides, they retorted that Nature and Practicality agreed that the front half of every human being (that is, the half containing the eye and mouth) should be distinguishable from the back half. They therefore brought before a general and extraordinary Assembly of all the States of Flatland a Bill proposing that for every Woman, the half containing the eye and mouth should be colored red, and the other half green. The Priests were to be painted in the same way, with red applied to the semicircle where the eye and mouth were in the middle, and the other or back semicircle colored green.
</p>

<p>
There was a lot of cunning in this proposal. It didn't come from any Isosceles - no being that degraded would have the intelligence to appreciate, let alone devise, such a model of statecraft. It came from an Irregular Circle who, instead of being destroyed in childhood, was spared by foolish indulgence to bring disaster to his country and destruction to millions of followers.
</p>

<p>
On one hand, the proposition was designed to bring Women of all classes over to the side of the Chromatic Innovation. By giving Women the same two colors as the Priests, the Revolutionists ensured that in certain positions, every Woman would appear as a Priest and be treated with corresponding respect and deference - a prospect that couldn't fail to attract the Female Sex en masse.
</p>

<p>
But some of my Readers might not recognize how Priests and Women could look identical under this new legislation. If so, a word or two will make it clear.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a woman decorated according to the new Code: her front half (the half with the eye and mouth) is red, and her back half is green. Look at her from the side. Obviously, you'll see a straight line, half red and half green.
</p>

<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/img05.jpg" />
</figure>
</center>

<p>
Now imagine a Priest, whose mouth is at M, and whose front semicircle (AMB) is therefore colored red, while his back semicircle is green, so that the diameter AB divides the green from the red. If you look at the Great Man so that your eye is in the same straight line as his dividing diameter (AB), what you'll see will be a straight line (CBD), of which one half (CB) will be red, and the other (BD) green. The whole line (CD) will be a bit shorter than that of a full-sized Woman, and will fade more quickly towards its ends, but the similarity of the colors would give you an immediate impression of similarity in Class, making you overlook other details.
</p>

<p>
Remember the decay of Sight Recognition that was threatening society at the time of the Color revolt. Add to that the certainty that Women would quickly learn to shade their extremities to imitate the Circles. It must then be obvious to you, my dear Reader, that the Color Bill put us in great danger of confusing a Priest with a young Woman.
</p>

<p>
How attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex! They looked forward with delight to the confusion that would follow. At home, they might overhear political and ecclesiastical secrets meant for their husbands and brothers, and might even issue commands in the name of a priestly Circle. Outside, the striking combination of red and green without any other colors would surely lead common people into endless mistakes, and Women would gain whatever respect the Circles lost from passersby. As for the scandal that would befall the Circular Class if the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the Women were blamed on them, and the consequent subversion of the Constitution, the Female Sex couldn't be expected to give a thought to these considerations. Even in the households of the Circles, the Women were all in favor of the Universal Color Bill.
</p>

<p>
The second aim of the Bill was the gradual demoralization of the Circles themselves. In the general intellectual decay, they still maintained their pristine clearness and strength of understanding. From their earliest childhood, growing up in Circular households completely devoid of Color, the Nobles alone preserved the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages that come from that excellent training of the intellect. Thus, up until the introduction of the Universal Color Bill, the Circles had not only held their own but even increased their lead over the other classes by abstaining from the popular fashion.
</p>

<p>
Now, therefore, the artful Irregular whom I described above as the real author of this diabolical Bill determined to bring down the status of the Hierarchy in one fell swoop. He would force them to submit to the pollution of Color, and at the same time destroy their domestic opportunities to train in the Art of Sight Recognition, thus weakening their intellects by depriving them of their pure and colorless homes. Once subjected to the chromatic taint, every parental and childish Circle would corrupt each other. Only in distinguishing between Father and Mother would the Circular infant find problems to exercise its understanding - problems too often likely to be corrupted by maternal deceptions, shaking the child's faith in all logical conclusions. Thus, bit by bit, the intellectual brilliance of the Priestly Order would fade, paving the way for a total destruction of all Aristocratic Legislature and for the subversion of our Privileged Classes.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 10: How the Color Rebellion Was Crushed</h2>

<p>
The campaign for the Universal Color Bill went on for three years. Right up to the last moment, it looked like chaos was going to win.
</p>

<p>
A whole army of Polygons, who had signed up to fight as regular soldiers, was completely wiped out by a larger force of Isosceles Triangles. Meanwhile, the Squares and Pentagons stayed neutral.
</p>

<p>
Even worse, some of the most capable Circles fell victim to domestic violence. Driven mad by political anger, the wives in many noble households pestered their husbands endlessly to give up their opposition to the Color Bill. Some, finding their pleas ignored, went berserk and killed their innocent children and husband, then took their own lives in the act of violence. It's recorded that during this three-year period, no fewer than twenty-three Circles died in domestic disputes.
</p>

<p>
The danger was extreme. It seemed the Priests had no choice but to either give in or be wiped out. But then, the course of events was completely changed by one of those dramatic incidents that politicians should never ignore, often anticipate, and sometimes even create. These incidents have an absurdly disproportionate power to sway the public's emotions.
</p>

<p>
Here's what happened: An Isosceles of a low type, with a brain barely above four degrees, was messing around with some paints he'd stolen from a shopkeeper. He either painted himself or got someone else to paint him (the story varies) with the twelve colors of a Dodecagon. He went into the Market Place and, disguising his voice, approached an orphan girl who was the daughter of a noble Polygon. In the past, he had tried unsuccessfully to win her affection. Through a series of deceptions – helped on one hand by a string of lucky accidents too long to relate, and on the other by an almost unbelievable carelessness on the part of the girl's relatives – he managed to marry her. The unhappy girl committed suicide when she discovered the fraud she had been subjected to.
</p>

<p>
When news of this tragedy spread from State to State, it deeply affected the minds of the Women. They sympathized with the miserable victim and worried that they, their sisters, or their daughters might face similar deceptions. This made them see the Color Bill in a completely new light. Many openly admitted they had changed their minds; the rest just needed a little push to make a similar admission. Seizing this favorable opportunity, the Circles quickly called an extraordinary Assembly of the States. Besides the usual guard of Convicts, they made sure a large number of reactionary Women attended.
</p>

<p>
Amid an unprecedented crowd, the Chief Circle of those days – Pantocyclus by name – stood up to find himself hissed and booed by a hundred and twenty thousand Isosceles. But he quieted them by announcing that from now on, the Circles would adopt a policy of Concession; they would accept the Color Bill to satisfy the majority's wishes. The jeers immediately turned to applause, and he invited Chromatistes, the leader of the Sedition, to come to the center of the hall to receive the submission of the Hierarchy on behalf of his followers. Then followed a speech, a masterpiece of rhetoric, which took nearly a day to deliver, and which no summary can do justice to.
</p>

<p>
With a show of impartiality, he declared that as they were now finally committing to Reform or Innovation, they should take one last look at the pros and cons of the whole subject, its flaws as well as its advantages. Gradually bringing up the dangers to the Tradesmen, the Professional Classes and the Gentlemen, he silenced the rising murmurs of the Isosceles by reminding them that, despite all these flaws, he was willing to accept the Bill if the majority approved it. But it was clear that everyone except the Isosceles was moved by his words and was either neutral or against the Bill.
</p>

<p>
Turning to the Workmen, he insisted that their interests must not be neglected, and that if they intended to accept the Color Bill, they should at least do so with a full understanding of the consequences. Many of them, he said, were on the verge of being admitted to the class of the Regular Triangles; others hoped their children would achieve a distinction they couldn't hope for themselves. That honorable ambition would have to be sacrificed. With the universal adoption of Color, all distinctions would disappear; Regularity would be confused with Irregularity; development would give way to regression; the Workman would, in a few generations, be degraded to the level of the Military, or even the Convict Class; political power would be in the hands of the greatest number, that is to say the Criminal Classes, who were already more numerous than the Workmen, and would soon outnumber all the other Classes put together when the usual Compensative Laws of Nature were violated.
</p>

<p>
A subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans, and Chromatistes, in alarm, tried to step forward and address them. But he found himself surrounded by guards and forced to remain silent while the Chief Circle made a final passionate appeal to the Women. He exclaimed that if the Color Bill passed, no marriage would be safe, no woman's honor secure; fraud, deception, and hypocrisy would invade every household; domestic happiness would share the fate of the Constitution and quickly perish. "Rather than this," he cried, "come death!"
</p>

<p>
At these words, which were the prearranged signal for action, the Isosceles Convicts fell on and stabbed the wretched Chromatistes; the Regular Classes, opening their ranks, made way for a band of Women who, under the Circles' direction, moved backwards, invisibly and unerringly upon the unconscious soldiers; the Artisans, imitating their betters, also opened their ranks. Meanwhile, bands of Convicts occupied every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx.
</p>

<p>
The battle, or rather carnage, was short-lived. Under the skillful generalship of the Circles, almost every Woman's charge was fatal and many extracted their sting uninjured, ready for a second slaughter. But no second blow was needed; the rabble of the Isosceles did the rest of the job themselves. Surprised, leaderless, attacked in front by invisible foes, and finding escape cut off by the Convicts behind them, they lost all presence of mind, as is their habit, and raised the cry of "treachery." This sealed their fate. Every Isosceles now saw an enemy in every other. In half an hour, not one of that vast multitude was left alive; and the fragments of seven score thousand of the Criminal Class slain by one another's angles attested to the triumph of Order.
</p>

<p>
The Circles didn't delay in pushing their victory to the utmost. The Working Men they spared but decimated. The Militia of the Equilaterals was immediately called out, and every Triangle suspected of Irregularity on reasonable grounds was destroyed by Court Martial, without the formality of exact measurement by the Social Board. The homes of the Military and Artisan classes were inspected in a course of visitations extending through upwards of a year; and during that period, every town, village, and hamlet was systematically purged of that excess of the lower orders which had been brought about by the neglect to pay the tribute of Criminals to the Schools and University, and by the violation of other natural Laws of the Constitution of Flatland. Thus the balance of classes was again restored.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, from then on, the use of Color was abolished, and its possession prohibited. Even the utterance of any word denoting Color, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was punished by a severe penalty. Only at our University in some of the very highest and most esoteric classes—which I myself have never been privileged to attend—it is understood that the sparing use of Color is still sanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper problems of mathematics. But of this I can only speak from hearsay.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in Flatland, Color is now non-existent. The art of making it is known to only one living person, the Chief Circle for the time being; and by him it is handed down on his death-bed to none but his Successor. One factory alone produces it; and, to prevent the secret from being betrayed, the Workmen are annually consumed, and fresh ones introduced. So great is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy looks back to the far-distant days of the agitation for the Universal Color Bill.
</p>



<h2>Chapter 11: About Our Priests</h2>

<p>
It's high time I move on from these brief and scattered notes about life in Flatland to the main event of this book: my introduction to the mysteries of Space. That's my real subject; everything that's come before is just a preface.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, I have to skip over many topics that I think would interest my readers. For example, I won't explain how we move around and stop ourselves, even though we don't have feet; or how we make buildings stable out of wood, stone, or brick, even though we don't have hands and can't lay foundations like you can, or use the sideways pressure of the earth; or how rain forms in the gaps between our different zones, so that the northern regions don't block the moisture falling on the southern parts; or about the nature of our hills and mines, our trees and vegetables, our seasons and harvests; our alphabet and way of writing, adapted to our linear tablets. These and a hundred other details of our physical existence I have to pass over. I'm not mentioning them now just to let my readers know that I haven't forgotten about them, but because I'm thinking about the reader's time.
</p>

<p>
But before I get to my main subject, my readers will probably expect a few final remarks about these pillars and mainstays of our Constitution, the controllers of our behavior and shapers of our destiny, the objects of universal respect and almost worship: I mean, of course, our Circles or Priests.
</p>

<p>
When I call them Priests, don't think I mean just what that term means to you. With us, our Priests are in charge of all Business, Art, and Science; they're Directors of Trade, Commerce, Generalship, Architecture, Engineering, Education, Statesmanship, Legislature, Morality, Theology; they don't do anything themselves, but they're the reason for everything worth doing that's done by others.
</p>

<p>
Although everyone popularly called a Circle is thought to be a Circle, among the better educated Classes it's known that no Circle is really a Circle, but only a Polygon with a very large number of very small sides. As the number of sides increases, a Polygon gets closer to being a Circle; and when the number is very large indeed, say three or four hundred, it's extremely difficult for even the most delicate touch to feel any polygonal angles. Let me say rather, it would be difficult: because, as I've explained before, Recognition by Feeling is unknown among the highest society, and to feel a Circle would be considered a very rude insult. This habit of not Feeling in the best society makes it easier for a Circle to keep up the mystery about the exact nature of his Perimeter or Circumference, which he's been used to wrapping in secrecy from his earliest years. Three feet being the average Perimeter, it follows that in a Polygon of three hundred sides, each side will be no more than the hundredth part of a foot in length, or little more than the tenth part of an inch; and in a Polygon of six or seven hundred sides, the sides are little larger than the diameter of a Spaceland pin-head. It's always assumed, out of politeness, that the Chief Circle for the time being has ten thousand sides.
</p>

<p>
The rise of the posterity of the Circles in the social scale isn't restricted, as it is among the lower Regular classes, by the Law of Nature which limits the increase of sides to one in each generation. If it were, the number of sides in a Circle would just be a matter of family history and math, and the four hundred and ninety-seventh descendant of an Equilateral Triangle would necessarily be a polygon with five hundred sides. But that's not the case. Nature's Law sets up two opposing rules affecting Circular reproduction: first, as the race climbs higher in the scale of development, development should speed up; second, in the same proportion, the race should become less fertile. As a result, in the home of a Polygon of four or five hundred sides, it's rare to find a son; more than one is never seen. On the other hand, the son of a five-hundred-sided Polygon has been known to have five hundred and fifty, or even six hundred sides.
</p>

<p>
Art also steps in to help the process of higher Evolution. Our doctors have discovered that the small and delicate sides of an infant Polygon of the higher class can be broken, and his whole frame reset, with such precision that a Polygon of two or three hundred sides sometimes—not always, because the process is very risky—but sometimes jumps over two or three hundred generations, and doubles the number of his progenitors and the nobility of his descent in one go.
</p>

<p>
Many a promising child is sacrificed in this way. Barely one out of ten survives. Yet the parental ambition among those Polygons who are, as it were, on the edge of the Circular class, is so strong that it's very rare to find a Nobleman of that position in society who hasn't placed his first-born in the Circular Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium before he's a month old.
</p>

<p>
One year determines success or failure. At the end of that time, the child has, in all probability, added one more to the tombstones that crowd the Neo-Therapeutic Cemetery; but on rare occasions, a joyful procession brings the little one back to his excited parents, no longer a Polygon, but a Circle, at least by courtesy: and a single instance of such a blessed result encourages multitudes of Polygonal parents to submit to similar domestic sacrifices, which often have a different outcome.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 12: What Our Priests Teach</h2>

<p>
To sum up what our Priests believe, it all comes down to one main idea: "Pay attention to your Shape." Whether it's about politics, religion, or morals, all their teachings aim to improve the Shape of individuals and society as a whole. Of course, they're especially focused on improving the Shape of the Circles, which is considered more important than anything else.
</p>

<p>
The Circles deserve credit for effectively putting an end to old-fashioned ideas. These outdated beliefs used to make people waste energy and sympathy on the mistaken notion that behavior depends on things like willpower, effort, training, encouragement, praise, or anything other than Shape. It was Pantocyclus – the famous Circle I mentioned earlier who stopped the Color Revolt – who first convinced everyone that Shape determines who you are. 
</p>

<p>
He taught that if you're born an Isosceles (a triangle with two equal sides) with uneven sides, you're bound to go wrong unless you get those sides evened out. For that, you need to go to the Isosceles Hospital. Similarly, if you're a Triangle, Square, or even a Pentagon born with any kind of Irregularity, you have to go to one of the Regular Hospitals to get your condition treated. If you don't, you'll end up in the State Prison or facing execution by the State.
</p>

<p>
Pantocyclus blamed all faults and flaws, from the smallest misbehavior to the worst crimes, on some deviation from perfect Regularity in body shape. He thought this could be caused by things like bumping into someone in a crowd, not exercising enough (or exercising too much), or even by sudden temperature changes that might shrink or expand a part of the body. 
</p>

<p>
So, this great Philosopher concluded, neither good behavior nor bad behavior should be praised or blamed. After all, why praise a Square for honestly defending his client's interests, when you should really be admiring how perfectly right-angled he is? Or why blame a dishonest, thieving Isosceles, when you should really feel sorry for his unavoidably unequal sides?
</p>

<p>
In theory, this idea makes perfect sense. But in practice, it has some drawbacks. When dealing with an Isosceles criminal who says he can't help stealing because of his uneven shape, you, as a judge, can reply that for that very reason – because he can't help being a nuisance to his neighbors – you can't help sentencing him to be executed. And that's the end of the matter.
</p>

<p>
But in small family disagreements, where execution isn't an option, this theory of Shape can be awkward. I have to admit, sometimes when one of my Hexagonal Grandsons uses the excuse that a sudden temperature change has affected his Perimeter, making him disobedient, and that I should blame his Shape rather than him – and that the only solution is to give him lots of the best sweets – I'm not sure how to respond. Logically, I can't reject his argument, but I also can't practically accept it.
</p>

<p>
For my part, I find it best to assume that a good scolding or punishment somehow strengthens my Grandson's Shape, even though I don't have any real reason to think so. At any rate, I'm not alone in dealing with this dilemma this way. I know that many high-ranking Circles, when they're judging in court, use praise and blame for Regular and Irregular Figures. At home, when scolding their children, they talk about "right" and "wrong" as passionately as if they really believed these words meant something real, and as if a person could actually choose between them.
</p>


<p>
The Circles constantly push their agenda of making Shape the most important idea in everyone's mind. They even flip the rule that governs parent-child relationships in your world. In your 3D world, children are taught to respect their parents. But in our world, after the Circles (who are the most honored), a man is taught to respect his grandson if he has one, or if not, his son. By 'respect,' we don't mean 'spoil,' but rather to have a genuine concern for their best interests. The Circles teach that fathers should put their own interests second to those of future generations. This way, they improve the welfare of the whole country as well as their own direct descendants.
</p>

<p>
But if I, a humble Square, can dare to point out a weakness in the Circles' system, it would be in how they deal with women.
</p>

<p>
It's super important for our society to discourage irregular births. So, no woman with any irregularities in her family history is considered a good match for a man who wants his kids to move up the social ladder step by step.
</p>

<p>
Now, a man's irregularity is easy to measure. But since all women are straight lines and look regular, we have to find another way to figure out their hidden irregularities - that is, the potential irregularities in their future children. We do this with carefully kept family trees, which are maintained and checked by the government. No woman is allowed to marry without an official family history.
</p>

<p>
You might think that a Circle, proud of his ancestors and caring about his future family (which might someday produce a Chief Circle), would be extra careful to choose a wife with a perfect family history. But surprisingly, it's not like that. The higher up the social ladder you go, the less people seem to care about choosing a regular wife.
</p>

<p>
An ambitious Isosceles, hoping to have an Equilateral son, wouldn't dream of marrying a woman with even one irregularity in her family tree. A Square or Pentagon, confident that his family is on the rise, doesn't bother checking beyond the 500th generation. A Hexagon or Dodecagon is even more careless about his wife's background. But get this - a Circle has been known to purposely marry a woman who had an Irregular great-grandfather, all because of some small improvement in her brightness, or because she had a nice low voice - which, in our world even more than yours, is considered a great thing in a woman.
</p>

<p>
As you might expect, these poorly thought-out marriages often don't produce children, or if they do, the children have fewer sides or are irregular. But none of these problems have been enough to stop this trend. The loss of a few sides in a highly developed Polygon isn't easily noticed, and sometimes it can be fixed with a successful operation in the Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium, as I mentioned before. Also, the Circles are too ready to accept not having children as a sign of higher development. But if this problem isn't fixed, the Circle class might start shrinking more quickly, and soon there might not be enough of them to produce a Chief Circle. If that happens, our whole system of government in Flatland will fall apart.
</p>

<p>
There's one more warning I should give, though I'm not sure how to fix this problem. This also has to do with how we treat women. About 300 years ago, the Chief Circle decided that since women don't have much reason but have lots of emotion, they shouldn't be treated as rational beings or given any mental education. As a result, women aren't taught to read anymore, or even to learn enough math to count the angles of their husband or children. Because of this, each generation of women has become less and less intelligent. This system of not educating women, or keeping them quiet, is still in place today.
</p>

<p>
I'm worried that even though this policy was started with good intentions, it's been taken so far that it's now hurting men too.
</p>

<p>
The result is that we men now have to live a kind of double life, both in our language and in our thinking. With women, we talk about things like 'love,' 'duty,' 'right,' 'wrong,' 'pity,' 'hope,' and other irrational and emotional ideas that don't really exist. We only use these words to control women's excessive emotions. But among ourselves and in our books, we use a completely different vocabulary and way of thinking. 'Love' becomes 'expecting benefits,' 'duty' becomes 'necessity' or 'fitness,' and other words are changed in similar ways.
</p>

<p>
Also, when we're around women, we use language that shows extreme respect for them. They fully believe that even the Chief Circle himself isn't worshipped by us more than they are. But behind their backs, everyone except the very young sees them as little more than 'mindless organisms' and talks about them that way.
</p>

<p>
Our religious teachings in the women's rooms are also completely different from our teachings elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm worried that this double training in language and thought is putting too much pressure on young people. This is especially true when, at three years old, they're taken away from their mothers and taught to unlearn the old language - except when they need to repeat it around their mothers and nurses - and learn the vocabulary and way of speaking used in science.
</p>

<p>
I think I'm already seeing a weakness in how well people understand mathematical truth these days, compared to the stronger minds of our ancestors three hundred years ago. I'm not saying anything about the possible danger if a woman were to secretly learn to read and tell other women what she learned from even one popular book. I'm also not talking about the chance that a young boy might accidentally reveal to his mother the secrets of our logical way of speaking.
</p>

<p>
Simply based on how this is weakening the male intellect, I humbly ask the highest Authorities to think again about the rules for female education."

<h2>Chapter 13: My Dream of Lineland</h2>

<p>
It was December 30, 1999, the second-to-last day of our year. I had been enjoying my favorite pastime, Geometry, late into the night and went to bed with an unsolved problem on my mind. That night, I had a strange dream.
</p>

<p>
I saw before me a vast crowd of small Straight Lines. I assumed these were Women, mixed with other, even smaller beings that looked like bright dots. All of these were moving back and forth along the same Straight Line, seemingly at the same speed.
</p>

<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/img06.jpg" />
</figure>
</center>

<p>
They made a confused, chirping noise while they moved. Sometimes they'd stop moving, and then everything would go quiet.
</p>

<p>
I approached one of the larger Lines, which I thought was a Woman, and tried to speak to her. I got no answer. I tried again, and again, but still nothing. Getting frustrated at what seemed like incredibly rude behavior, I positioned myself directly in front of her to block her path. Then I loudly repeated my question: "Woman, what's going on here? What's all this chirping about, and why is everyone moving back and forth on the same Straight Line?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a Woman," the small Line replied. "I am the Ruler of this world. But you, where do you come from, intruding into my kingdom of Lineland?"
</p>

<p>
Surprised by this abrupt response, I apologized if I had startled or bothered His Royal Highness. I explained that I was a stranger and asked if he could tell me about his kingdom. But I had a really hard time getting any useful information. The King kept assuming that whatever he knew, I must know too, and that I was just pretending to be ignorant as a joke. But by asking a lot of questions, I managed to learn the following:
</p>

<p>
It turned out that this poor, clueless King believed that the Straight Line he called his Kingdom – the Line he spent his whole existence on – was the entire world, indeed the whole of Space itself. Since he couldn't move or see except along his Straight Line, he couldn't even imagine anything outside of it. 
</p>

<p>
When I first spoke to him, he had heard my voice, but the sound had come to him in a way that was completely foreign to his experience. As he put it, he "heard a voice as if from my own insides." It wasn't until I put my mouth in his world that he had any sense of me at all. Even then, he had no idea about the region I came from. Outside his World, or Line, everything was a blank to him. No, not even a blank, because a blank implies Space. To him, everything outside his Line simply didn't exist.
</p>

<p>
All of his subjects – the small Lines he called men and the Points he called women – were also confined in their movement and sight to that single Straight Line, which was their entire World. Their whole horizon was limited to a Point; no one could ever see anything but a Point. 
</p>

<p>
In Lineland, you could only tell the difference between a man, woman, or child by the sound of their voice. Also, because each individual occupied the whole of the narrow path that made up their Universe, no one could ever pass another. Once you were neighbors with someone, you were always neighbors. Being neighbors in Lineland was like being married in our world – you stayed that way until death parted you.
</p>

<p>
To me, such a life seemed incredibly boring – all vision limited to a Point, all movement confined to a Straight Line. I was surprised to see how lively and cheerful the King seemed. Wondering if it was possible to have any kind of family life under such limiting circumstances, I hesitated for a while before asking about such a delicate subject. But finally, I took the plunge and asked about the health of his family.
</p>

<p>
"My wives and children are well and happy," he replied.
</p>

<p>
I was shocked by this answer. In the immediate vicinity of the King, I had noticed there were only Men. So I ventured to reply, "Pardon me, but I can't imagine how Your Royal Highness can ever see or approach your Family. There are at least half a dozen individuals between you and them, whom you can neither see through nor pass by. Is it possible that in Lineland, closeness isn't necessary for marriage or having children?"
</p>

<p>
"What an absurd question!" replied the Monarch. "If it were as you suggest, the Universe would soon be empty. No, no; nearness isn't necessary for love, and the birth of children is far too important to depend on such an accident as proximity. You can't be ignorant of this. But since you're pretending not to know, I'll explain it to you as if you were a baby in Lineland.
</p>

<p>
"Know, then, that marriages are consummated by the sense of sound and the ability to hear. You're aware, of course, that every Man has two mouths or voices – as well as two eyes – a bass at one end and a tenor at the other. I wouldn't mention this, but I haven't been able to hear your tenor during our conversation."
</p>

<p>
I replied that I only had one voice, and I hadn't known that His Royal Highness had two. "That confirms my impression," said the King, "that you're not a Man, but some kind of monstrous being with a bass voice and a completely uneducated ear. But let me continue.
</p>

<p>
"Nature itself has decreed that every Man should marry two wives—" "Why two?" I asked. "You're taking your pretend simplicity too far," he cried. "How can there be a completely harmonious union without the combination of Four in One, namely, the Bass and Tenor of the Man and the Soprano and Contralto of the two Women?" "But suppose," I said, "that a man should prefer one wife or three?" "That's impossible," he said. "It's as unthinkable as the idea that two and one could make five, or that the human eye could see a Straight Line."
</p>

<p>
I wanted to interrupt him, but he went on: "Once in the middle of each week, a Law of Nature compels us to move back and forth with a rhythm that's more forceful than usual. This lasts for the time it would take you to count to one hundred and one. In the middle of this group dance, at the fifty-first beat, all the inhabitants of the Universe pause in their movement, and each individual sends out their richest, fullest, sweetest sound. It's in this crucial moment that all our marriages are made. The match between Bass and Treble, Tenor and Contralto is so perfect that often the destined Lovers, even if they're twenty thousand leagues apart, recognize each other's responsive note immediately. Despite the vast distance between them, Love unites the three. The marriage that results in this case produces threefold Male and Female offspring, which takes its place in Lineland."
</p>

<p>
"What! Always threefold?" I said. "Must one wife always have twins?"
</p>

<p>
"Bass-voiced Monster! Yes," replied the King. "How else could we maintain the balance between the sexes if two girls weren't born for every boy? Would you ignore the very basics of Nature?" He stopped speaking, speechless with anger, and it took some time before I could get him to continue his story.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, not every single person finds their perfect match during their first attempt at this universal Marriage Chorus. In fact, for most of us, this process is repeated many times. It's rare to find hearts that are lucky enough to immediately recognize their destined partner in each other's voices and instantly fall into a perfectly harmonious relationship.
</p>

<p>
For most of us, courtship is a long process. A potential partner's voice might match well with one of their future spouses, but not with both. Or it might not match with either at first. Sometimes, the high and low voices of the women might not blend well together. In these cases, Nature has made sure that each weekly Chorus brings the three potential lovers into better harmony.
</p>

<p>
Each time they try to match their voices, each time they discover a mismatch, the less perfect partners subtly adjust their vocal sounds to become more like the ideal. After many attempts and many small adjustments, they finally achieve the right match. Eventually, there comes a day when, during the usual Marriage Chorus across Lineland, three distant lovers suddenly find themselves in perfect harmony. Before they even realize it, the newly matched trio is swept up in a musical embrace. And so, Nature celebrates another marriage and the birth of three more Linelanders."
</p>


<h2>Chapter 14: My Failed Attempt to Explain Flatland</h2>

<p>
I thought it was time to bring the King down from his high horse and talk some sense into him. I decided to try and open his eyes to the truth - or at least, to help him understand what things are really like in Flatland. So I began:
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty, how do you tell the difference between your subjects' shapes and positions? For my part, before I entered your kingdom, I noticed by sight that some of your people are lines and others are points. I also saw that some lines are larger -"
</p>

<p>
The King cut me off. "You're talking nonsense!" he interrupted. "You must have been hallucinating. Everyone knows it's impossible to see the difference between a Line and a Point just by looking. You can only tell the difference by hearing. And that's also how you can figure out my shape exactly. Look at me - I'm a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of Space -"
</p>

<p>
"You mean Length," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Fool," he snapped. "Space is Length. Interrupt me again, and I'm done talking."
</p>

<p>
I apologized, but he continued scornfully, "Since you're too thick to understand logic, I'll let you hear for yourself how I use my two voices to show my shape to my Wives. They're currently six thousand miles, seventy yards, two feet, and eight inches away - one to the North, the other to the South. Listen, I'm calling to them."
</p>

<p>
He made a chirping sound, then went on smugly: "Right now, my wives are hearing one of my voices, quickly followed by the other. They can tell that the second voice reaches them after an interval in which sound can travel 6.457 inches. From this, they figure out that one of my mouths is 6.457 inches further from them than the other, and so they know my shape is 6.457 inches long. Of course, my wives don't do this calculation every time they hear my two voices. They did it once, before we got married. But they could do it anytime if they wanted to. And I can figure out the shape of any of my male subjects the same way, just by hearing them."
</p>

<p>
"But what if," I asked, "a man pretends to have a woman's voice with one of his voices, or disguises his southern voice so it doesn't sound like an echo of the northern one? Couldn't that cause a lot of confusion? And don't you have any way to prevent this kind of fraud by having your subjects touch each other to check?"
</p>

<p>
This was, of course, a pretty stupid question. Touch wouldn't have solved the problem at all. But I asked it to annoy the King, and it worked perfectly.
</p>

<p>
"What?!" he cried in horror. "Explain what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Feel, touch, come into contact," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"If by 'feeling' you mean getting so close that there's no space between two individuals," said the King, "you should know that in my kingdom, this crime is punishable by death. And the reason is obvious. A woman's delicate form could be shattered by such close contact, so the State must protect them. But since you can't tell women from men by sight, the law says that neither men nor women should get close enough to destroy the space between them."
</p>

<p>
"Besides, what possible use could there be for this illegal and unnatural 'touching' you're talking about? All the benefits of such a crude process are achieved more easily and accurately just by hearing. As for your suggestion about the risk of deception, it doesn't exist. A person's voice is the essence of their being - it can't be changed at will. But come on, let's say I could pass through solid objects and penetrate my subjects one by one, even up to a billion of them, checking the size and distance of each by 'feeling'. How much time and energy would be wasted on this clumsy and inaccurate method! Whereas now, in a single moment of listening, I can take a census and get statistics - local, physical, mental, and spiritual - of every living being in Lineland. Just listen!"
</p>

<p>
Saying this, he paused and seemed to go into a trance, listening to what sounded to me like nothing more than tiny chirping from countless miniature grasshoppers.
</p>

<p>
"Truly," I replied, "your sense of hearing serves you well and makes up for many of your limitations. But let me point out that your life in Lineland must be terribly dull. To see nothing but a Point! Not even being able to imagine a Straight Line! In fact, not even knowing what a Straight Line is! To see, yet be cut off from the linear views we have in Flatland! Surely it's better to have no sight at all than to see so little! I admit I don't have your impressive hearing ability. The concert of all Lineland that gives you such joy sounds like nothing more than a lot of twittering or chirping to me. But at least I can see the difference between a Line and a Point with my eyes. Let me prove it. Just before I came into your kingdom, I saw you dancing from left to right, and then from right to left. There were seven men and a woman close to you on the left, and eight men and two women on your right. Isn't that correct?"
</p>

<p>
"It's correct as far as the numbers and genders go," said the King, "though I don't know what you mean by 'right' and 'left.' But I deny that you saw these things. How could you see the Line, that is, the inside, of any Man? You must have heard these things and then dreamed that you saw them. And let me ask what you mean by those words 'left' and 'right.' I assume it's your way of saying Northward and Southward."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," I replied. "Besides your motion Northward and Southward, there's another motion which I call from right to left."
</p>

<p>
King: Show me, if you please, this motion from left to right.
</p>

<p>
Me: I'm afraid I can't do that unless you could step out of your Line altogether.
</p>

<p>
King: Out of my Line? Do you mean out of the world? Out of Space?
</p>

<p>
Me: Well, yes. Out of your world. Out of your Space. Because your Space isn't the true Space. True Space is a Plane, but your Space is only a Line.
</p>

<p>
King: If you can't demonstrate this motion from left to right by moving yourself, then please describe it to me in words.
</p>

<p>
Me: If you can't tell your right side from your left, I'm afraid no words of mine can make my meaning any clearer to you. But surely you can't be ignorant of such a simple distinction.
</p>

<p>
King: I don't understand you at all.
</p>

<p>
Me: Oh, dear. How can I make this clear? When you move straight on, don't you ever feel like you could move in some other way, turning your eye around so you could look in the direction your side is now facing? In other words, instead of always moving in the direction of one of your ends, don't you ever want to move in the direction of, so to speak, your side?
</p>

<p>
King: Never. And what do you mean? How can a man's inside "face" in any direction? Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?
</p>

<p>
Me: Well then, since words can't explain it, I'll try to show you with actions. I'll gradually move out of Lineland in the direction I'm trying to explain to you.
</p>

<center>

</figure>
</center>

<p>
At this point, I began to move my body out of Lineland. As long as any part of me was still in his kingdom and visible to him, the King kept shouting, "I see you, I see you still; you're not moving." But when I had finally moved completely out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest voice, "She's vanished; she's dead."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not dead," I replied. "I'm simply out of Lineland, which means out of the Straight Line you call Space. I'm in the true Space, where I can see things as they really are. And right now, I can see your Line, or side - or inside as you like to call it. I can also see the Men and Women to the North and South of you. I'll list them now, describing their order, their size, and the distance between each."
</p>

<p>
After I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, "Does that finally convince you?"
</p>

<p>
With that, I once again entered Lineland, taking up the same position as before.
</p>

<p>
But the King replied, "If you were sensible - though since you seem to have only one voice, I strongly suspect you're not a Man but a Woman - but if you had even a shred of sense, you'd listen to reason. You're asking me to believe that there's another Line besides the one my senses show me, and another kind of motion besides the one I experience every day. In return, I ask you to describe in words or show by motion this other Line you're talking about. Instead of moving, you just use some magic trick to disappear and reappear. And instead of giving me a clear description of your new World, you just tell me the numbers and sizes of about forty people in my court - facts that any child in my capital would know. Can anything be more irrational or outrageous? Either admit you're wrong or leave my kingdom."
</p>

<p>
Furious at his stubbornness, and especially angry that he claimed not to know my gender, I shot back in no uncertain terms: "You blind fool! You think you're the pinnacle of existence, but you're actually the most imperfect and stupid of all beings. You claim to see, but you see nothing but a Point! You pride yourself on being able to deduce the existence of a Straight Line, but I can see Straight Lines, and I can deduce the existence of Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles. Why waste more words? Let me just say that I am the completion of your incomplete self. You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines, called in my country a Square. Even I, infinitely superior as I am to you, am of little importance among the great nobles of Flatland, from where I've come to visit you, hoping to enlighten your ignorance."
</p>

<p>
Hearing these words, the King rushed towards me with a threatening cry as if to stab me through my diagonal. At that same moment, a deafening war cry rose from millions of his subjects, growing louder and louder until I thought it rivaled the roar of an army of a hundred thousand Isosceles and the artillery of a thousand Pentagons. Paralyzed with fear, I could neither speak nor move to avoid the coming destruction. The noise grew even louder, and the King came closer, when suddenly I woke up to find the breakfast bell calling me back to the realities of Flatland.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 15: A Visitor from the 3D World</h2>

<p>
It was New Year's Eve, 1999 - the last day of our millennium. The sound of rain outside told me it was night. I was sitting<sup>[3]</sup> with my wife, thinking about the past year and what the future might bring - not just for the next year, but for the new century and even the new millennium.
</p>

<p class="footnote" id="foot3">
[3]: When I say "sitting," I don't mean changing position like you do in Spaceland. Since we have no feet, we can't "sit" or "stand" as you understand those words, any more than one of your soles or flounders could.

However, we can definitely recognize the different mental states of willpower implied by "lying," "sitting," and "standing." To some extent, an observer can see these states as a slight increase in brightness that matches the increase in willpower.

But I don't have time to go into detail about this and a thousand other related topics.
</p>

<p>
My four sons and two orphaned grandchildren had gone to bed. Only my wife was still with me, waiting to see the old millennium out and the new one in.
</p>

<p>
I was lost in thought, mulling over something my youngest grandson, a bright young hexagon, had said earlier. My uncles and I had been giving him his usual lesson in recognizing shapes by sight. We were spinning around and asking him to identify our positions. He did so well that I decided to reward him with some tips on how to use math in geometry.
</p>

<p>
I took nine squares, each one inch on all sides, and arranged them to make one big square that was three inches on each side. I used this to show my grandson that even though we can't see inside the big square, we can figure out how many square inches it contains by multiplying the length of one side by itself. "So," I said, "we know that 3 squared, or 9, tells us how many square inches are in a square with 3-inch sides."
</p>

<p>
The little hexagon thought about this for a moment, then asked, "But you've been teaching me about cubing numbers too. What does 3 cubed mean in geometry?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all," I replied, "at least not in geometry as we know it. Our geometry only has two dimensions."
</p>

<p>
I then started to explain how a point moving three inches creates a three-inch line, which we represent with the number 3. And how a three-inch line, moving parallel to itself for three inches, creates a square that's three inches on each side, which we represent as 3 squared.
</p>

<p>
But before I could finish, my grandson interrupted, "Well then, if a point moving three inches makes a line represented by 3, and a line moving three inches makes a square represented by 3 squared, then shouldn't a square moving three inches make... something else that's represented by 3 cubed?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to bed," I said, a bit annoyed by the interruption. "If you talked less nonsense, you might remember more sense."
</p>

<p>
So my grandson left, feeling told off, and there I sat next to my wife, trying to look back on the year 1999 and think about what 2000 might bring. But I couldn't quite shake off the thoughts stirred up by my clever little hexagon's chatter.
</p>

<p>
Only a few grains of sand were left in the half-hour glass. I shook myself out of my daydream, turned the glass northward one last time in the old millennium, and muttered, "The boy's a fool."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, I felt a presence in the room. A chilling breeze ran through me. "He is no such thing," my wife scolded, "and you're breaking the rules by insulting your own grandson." But I ignored her.
</p>

<p>
I looked around but couldn't see anything. Yet I still felt that presence and shivered as the cold whisper came again. I jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong?" my wife asked. "There's no draft. What are you looking for? There's nothing there."
</p>

<p>
She was right - there was nothing. I sat back down and said again, "The boy's a fool. 3 cubed doesn't mean anything in geometry."
</p>

<p>
Immediately, I heard a clear reply: "The boy isn't a fool, and 3 cubed does have a clear geometric meaning."
</p>

<p>
Both my wife and I heard the words, though she didn't understand what they meant. We both leaped up, looking in the direction of the sound. To our horror, we saw a Figure!
</p>

<p>
At first glance, it looked like a woman seen from the side. But after a moment, I realized the ends faded too quickly for it to be female. I thought it might be a circle, except it seemed to change size in a way that was impossible for any regular shape I knew of.
</p>

<p>
My wife, not having my experience or the cool head needed to notice these details, jumped to the conclusion that a woman had somehow gotten into the house. "How did this person get in?" she exclaimed. "You promised me there wouldn't be any vents in our new house."
</p>

<p>
"There aren't any," I said. "But what makes you think the stranger is a woman? I can tell by sight that-"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't care about your sight recognition," she interrupted. "'Feeling is believing' and 'A straight line to touch is worth a circle to see' - that's what we women say."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, trying not to annoy her further, "if that's how you want it, go ahead and ask for an introduction."
</p>

<p>
Putting on her most polite manner, my wife approached the stranger. "May I feel and be felt by-" she began, but suddenly jumped back. "Oh! It's not a woman at all, and there are no angles either. Could it be that I've been so rude to a perfect Circle?"
</p>

<p>
"I am indeed, in a way, a Circle," the Voice replied, "and a more perfect Circle than any in Flatland. But to be more accurate, I am many Circles in one." Then, speaking more gently, the Voice continued, "I have a message for your husband, which I can't deliver in your presence. If you could leave us alone for a few minutes-"
</p>

<p>
But my wife wouldn't hear of our guest inconveniencing himself. Assuring the Circle that it was long past her bedtime anyway, and apologizing again for her recent mistake, she finally went to her room.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the half-hour glass. The last grains of sand had fallen. The third millennium had begun.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 16: How the Stranger Tried and Failed to Explain Spaceland to Me Using Just Words</h2>

<p>
As soon as I couldn't hear my wife's "goodbye" anymore, I started to approach the Stranger. I wanted to get a closer look and offer him a seat. But his appearance shocked me so much that I froze, unable to speak or move.
</p>

<p>
The Stranger kept changing size and brightness in ways I'd never seen before. It seemed impossible for any shape I knew. A terrifying thought crossed my mind: What if this wasn't a Circle at all, but some kind of criminal – a super irregular Triangle? What if he was pretending to be a Circle and had somehow snuck into my house? What if he was about to stab me with his sharp angle?
</p>

<p>
In my room, without any fog (and it happened to be a very dry season), it was hard for me to trust what I was seeing. This was especially true at the short distance between us. Panicking, I rushed forward and rudely said, "I must touch you, sir—" and I felt him.
</p>

<p>
My wife had been right. There wasn't even a hint of an angle, not the slightest roughness or unevenness. Never in my life had I met such a perfect Circle. He didn't move while I walked around him, starting from his eye and coming back to it again. He was completely circular, a flawless Circle through and through. There couldn't be any doubt about it.
</p>

<p>
Then we had a conversation, which I'll try to remember as best I can. I'll leave out most of my many apologies – I was so embarrassed and humiliated that I, a Square, had been rude enough to touch a Circle. The Stranger started the conversation, sounding a bit impatient about how long it took me to introduce myself.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: Have you touched me enough by now? Don't you feel like you know me yet?
</p>

<p>
Me: Most honorable Sir, please excuse my awkwardness. It's not because I don't know how to behave in polite society, but because I'm a bit surprised and nervous about this unexpected visit. Please, I beg you, don't tell anyone about my bad behavior, especially not my Wife. But before you say anything else, would you mind telling me where you came from?
</p>

<p>
Stranger: From Space, from Space, Sir. Where else?
</p>

<p>
Me: Excuse me, my Lord, but aren't you already in Space, just like me and everyone else, even right now?
</p>

<p>
Stranger: Nonsense! What do you know about Space? Define Space.
</p>

<p>
Me: Space, my Lord, is height and width that go on forever.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: Exactly. You see, you don't even know what Space really is. You think it only has Two Dimensions. But I've come to tell you about a Third – height, width, and length.
</p>

<p>
Me: Your Lordship seems to be joking. We also talk about length and height, or width and thickness, so we're using four names to describe Two Dimensions.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: But I'm talking about not just three names, but Three actual Dimensions.
</p>

<p>
Me: Would Your Lordship please show or explain to me which direction this Third Dimension is? I don't know about it.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: I came from it. It's up above and down below.
</p>

<p>
Me: My Lord seems to mean North and South.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: I mean nothing of the sort. I'm talking about a direction you can't see, because you don't have an eye on your side.
</p>

<p>
Me: Excuse me, my Lord, but if you look closely, you'll see I have a perfectly good eye at the point where my two sides meet.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: Yes, but to see into Space, you'd need an eye not on your edge, but on your side – what you'd probably call your inside, but what we in Spaceland would call your side.
</p>

<p>
Me: An eye on my inside? An eye in my stomach? Your Lordship must be joking.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: I'm not joking at all. I'm telling you that I come from Space, or since you don't understand what Space means, from the Land of Three Dimensions. From that vantage point, I could see everything you think of as solid (by which you mean "enclosed on four sides") – your houses, your churches, even your chests and safes, yes, even your insides and stomachs – all open and exposed to my view.
</p>

<p>
Me: Anyone can make claims like that, my Lord.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: But not easily proven, you mean. Well, I intend to prove mine.
</p>

<p>
When I came down here, I saw your four Sons, the Pentagons, each in his room, and your two orphan Grandsons the Hexagons. I saw your youngest Hexagon stay with you for a while and then go to his room, leaving you and your Wife alone. I saw your Isosceles servants, three of them, having supper in the kitchen, and the little Page in the scullery. Then I came here, and how do you think I got in?
</p>

<p>
Me: Through the roof, I suppose.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: Not at all. Your roof, as you well know, was recently fixed and has no opening that even a Woman could fit through. I tell you, I came from Space. Aren't you convinced by what I've told you about your children and household?
</p>

<p>
Me: Your Lordship must know that anyone in the neighborhood with your resources could easily find out such facts about my family.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: (to himself) What should I do? Wait, I have one more argument. (to me) When you see a Straight Line – your wife, for example – how many Dimensions do you think she has?
</p>

<p>
Me: Your Lordship wouldn't treat me like I'm one of the common people who, not knowing any math, think a Woman is really just a Straight Line with only One Dimension. No, no, my Lord. We Squares know better. We know that a Woman, though commonly called a Straight Line, is actually a very thin Parallelogram with Two Dimensions, like the rest of us – length and width (or thickness).
</p>

<p>
Stranger: But the very fact that you can see a Line means it must have another Dimension.
</p>

<p>
Me: My Lord, I just admitted that a Woman is wide as well as long. We see her length and assume her width, which, though very slight, can be measured.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: You don't understand me. I mean that when you see a Woman, you should – besides assuming her width – see her length, and see what we call her height, even though this last Dimension is incredibly small in your country. If a Line were just length without height, it wouldn't take up any Space and would be invisible. Surely you must see this?
</p>

<p>
Me: I have to admit that I don't understand Your Lordship at all. When we in Flatland see a Line, we see length and brightness. If the brightness disappears, the Line is gone, and as you say, it doesn't take up any Space. But am I to think that you're calling brightness a Dimension, and that what we call "bright" you call "high"?
</p>

<p>
Stranger: No, not at all. By "height" I mean a Dimension like your length. It's just that in your world, "height" isn't easy to notice because it's extremely small.
</p>

<p>
Me: My Lord, you say I have a Third Dimension that you call "height." But Dimension implies direction and measurement. Just measure my "height," or at least tell me which direction my "height" extends, and I'll believe you. Otherwise, you'll have to excuse me for not understanding.
</p>

<p>
Stranger: (to himself) I can't do either of those things. How can I convince him? Surely just stating the facts and then showing him should be enough. (to me) Now, Sir, listen to me.
</p>

<p>
You live on a Plane. What you call Flatland is the vast level surface of what I might call a fluid, on top of which you and your countrymen move around without ever rising above or sinking below it.
</p>

<p>
I'm not a flat Shape, but a Solid. You call me a Circle, but I'm not really a Circle. I'm an infinite number of Circles, ranging in size from a Point to a Circle thirteen inches across, all stacked on top of each other. When I cut through your plane like I'm doing now, I make a cross-section in your plane that you correctly call a Circle. Even a Sphere – which is my proper name in my own country – if it shows itself to someone in Flatland, has to appear as a Circle.
</p>

<p>
Don't you remember – because I, who can see everything, saw the ghostly vision of Lineland in your mind last night – don't you remember how when you visited Lineland, you had to appear to the King not as a Square, but as a Line? This was because that Linear world didn't have enough Dimensions to show all of you, but only a slice or cross-section of you. In exactly the same way, your Two-Dimensional country isn't big enough to represent me, a Three-Dimensional being. It can only show a slice or cross-section of me, which is what you call a Circle.
</p>

<p>
The dimming brightness of your eye shows you don't believe me. But now, get ready for solid proof of what I'm saying. You can't see more than one of my cross-sections, or Circles, at a time, because you can't lift your eye out of Flatland. But you can at least see that as I rise in Space, my cross-sections get smaller. Watch now as I rise. You'll see my Circle get smaller and smaller until it shrinks to a point and finally disappears.
</p>

<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/img08.jpg" />
</figure>
</center>

<p>
There was no "rising" that I could see, but he got smaller and finally vanished. I blinked once or twice to make sure I wasn't dreaming. But it wasn't a dream. From out of nowhere, I heard a hollow voice that seemed to come from inside me: "Am I completely gone? Are you convinced now? Well, now I'll slowly come back to Flatland, and you'll see my cross-section get bigger and bigger."
</p>

<p>
Every reader in Spaceland will easily understand that my mysterious Guest was speaking the truth in simple terms. But for me, even though I was good at Flatland mathematics, it wasn't so simple. The rough diagram above will make it clear to any Spaceland child that the Sphere, rising in the three positions shown there, would have to appear to me, or to any Flatlander, as a Circle – first full-sized, then small, and finally very small, almost a Point. But for me, even though I saw the facts in front of me, I couldn't understand why. All I could grasp was that the Circle had made himself smaller and disappeared, and now he had reappeared and was quickly making himself larger.
</p>

<p>
When he got back to his original size, he let out a deep sigh. He could tell from my silence that I hadn't understood him at all. To be honest, I was starting to think he might not be a Circle at all, but some incredibly clever magician. Or maybe the old wives' tales were true, and there really were such things as Enchanters and Magicians.
</p>

<p>
After a long pause, he muttered to himself, "I have only one option left if I don't want to resort to action. I must try using Analogy." Then, after an even longer silence, he continued our conversation.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Tell me, Mr. Mathematician, if a Point moves Northward and leaves a glowing trail behind it, what would you call that trail?
</p>

<p>
Me: A straight Line.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: And how many ends does a straight Line have?
</p>

<p>
Me: Two.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Now imagine that Northward-pointing straight Line moving parallel to itself, East and West, so that every point in it leaves behind the trail of a straight Line. What would you call the Shape created by this movement? Let's say it moves a distance equal to the original straight line. What would you call it?
</p>

<p>
Me: A square.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: And how many sides does a Square have? How many angles?
</p>

<p>
Me: Four sides and four angles.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Now use your imagination a little more and picture a Square in Flatland, moving parallel to itself upward.
</p>

<p>
Me: What? Northward?
</p>

<p>
Sphere: No, not Northward – upward, out of Flatland altogether.
</p>

<p>
If it moved Northward, the Southern points of the Square would have to move through the positions that the Northern points had occupied before. But that's not what I mean.
</p>

<p>
I mean that every Point in you – because you're a Square and will work for my example – every Point in you, that is, in what you call your inside, is to move upward through Space in such a way that no Point passes through a position that any other Point occupied before. Instead, each Point will trace its own straight Line. This all follows the rules of Analogy. Surely you must understand this now.
</p>

<p>
Holding back my impatience – because I was very tempted to rush at my Visitor and push him into Space, or out of Flatland, anywhere, just to get rid of him – I replied:
</p>

<p>
"And what kind of Shape am I supposed to create with this movement that you call 'upward'? I assume it can be described using Flatland language."
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Oh, certainly. It's all simple and straightforward, and follows the rules of Analogy – except, by the way, you shouldn't call the result a Shape, but a Solid. But I'll describe it to you. Or rather, not me, but Analogy will.
</p>

<p>
We started with a single Point, which of course – being just a Point – has only one end Point.
</p>

<p>
One Point creates a Line with two end Points.
</p>

<p>
One Line creates a Square with four end Points.
</p>

<p>
Now you can answer your own question: 1, 2, 4 are clearly in a Geometric Progression. What's the next number?
</p>

<p>
Me: Eight.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Exactly. The one Square produces a Something-you-don't-know-the-name-for-yet-but-which-we-call-a-Cube with eight end Points. Now do you understand?
</p>

<p>
Me: And does this thing have sides, as well as Angles or what you call "end Points"?
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Of course, and it all follows the rules of Analogy. But, by the way, not what you call sides, but what we call sides. You would call them solids.
</p>

<p>
Me: And how many solids or sides will this Being have? This Being that I'm supposed to create by moving my inside in an "upward" direction, which you call a Cube?
</p>

<p>
Sphere: How can you even ask that? And you call yourself a mathematician! The side of anything is always, if I may put it this way, one Dimension behind the thing itself. So, since there's no Dimension behind a Point, a Point has 0 sides; a Line, if I may say so, has 2 sides (because we can politely call the points of a Line its sides); a Square has 4 sides; 0, 2, 4 – what kind of Progression do you call that?
</p>

<p>
Me: Arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: And what's the next number?
</p>

<p>
Me: Six.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Exactly. So you've answered your own question. The Cube you're going to create will be bounded by six sides, which means six of your insides. You understand it all now, don't you?
</p>

<p>
"Monster!" I screamed. "Be you magician, enchanter, dream, or devil, I won't put up with your mockeries anymore. Either you or I must die." And saying this, I charged at him.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 17: How the Sphere, Failing with Words, Turned to Action</h2>

<p>
It was no use. I slammed my hardest right angle into the Stranger with all my might, using enough force to destroy any normal Circle. But I could feel him slowly and unstoppably slipping away from me. He wasn't moving to the right or left, but somehow moving out of our world, vanishing into nothing. Soon, he was gone. But I could still hear his voice.
</p>

<p>
Sphere: Why won't you listen to reason? I had hoped you, as a sensible person and skilled mathematician, would be the perfect messenger for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions. I'm only allowed to preach this once every thousand years. But now I don't know how to convince you. Wait, I have an idea. Actions speak louder than words. Listen, my friend.
</p>

<p>
I've told you that from where I am in Space, I can see inside everything you consider closed. For example, I can see into that cupboard near you. I see several of what you call boxes (though like everything in Flatland, they don't have tops or bottoms) full of money. I also see two account books. I'm going to go into that cupboard and bring you one of those books. I saw you lock the cupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have the key. But I'm coming down from Space; you'll see the doors don't move. Now I'm in the cupboard and taking the book. Now I have it. Now I'm coming back up with it.
</p>

<p>
I rushed to the closet and yanked the door open. One of the books was gone. With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other corner of the room, and at the same time, the book appeared on the floor. I picked it up. There was no doubt – it was the missing book.
</p>

<p>
I groaned in horror, wondering if I was losing my mind. But the Stranger continued:
</p>

<p>
"Surely you must see now that my explanation is the only one that fits what's happening. What you call solid things are really just surfaces. What you call Space is really just a big Plane. I am in Space, and I can look down and see the insides of things that you only see the outsides of. You could leave the Plane yourself if you could just summon up the necessary willpower. A slight upward or downward motion would let you see everything I can see.
</p>

<p>
"The higher I go, and the further I get from your Plane, the more I can see, though of course I see it on a smaller scale. For example, I'm going up now. Now I can see your neighbor, the Hexagon, and his family in their different rooms. Now I see inside the Theater, ten doors down, where the audience is just leaving. And on the other side, I see a Circle in his study, sitting at his books. Now I'll come back to you. And as final proof, what do you say to me giving you a little touch, just the tiniest touch, in your stomach? It won't seriously hurt you, and the slight pain you might feel is nothing compared to how much you'll learn."
</p>

<p>
Before I could say a word to object, I felt a sharp pain in my insides, and a demonic laugh seemed to come from within me. A moment later, the sharp pain stopped, leaving only a dull ache. The Stranger started to reappear, saying as he gradually got bigger, "There, I didn't hurt you much, did I? If you're not convinced now, I don't know what will convince you. What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
I made up my mind. I couldn't stand living at the mercy of a Magician who could play tricks with my very stomach whenever he wanted. If only I could somehow pin him against the wall until help came!
</p>

<p>
Once more, I threw my hardest angle at him, while at the same time yelling for help to alert the whole household. I think at the moment I attacked, the Stranger had sunk below our Plane and was having trouble rising. In any case, he didn't move, while I, thinking I heard help coming, pressed against him even harder and kept shouting for assistance.
</p>

<p>
A convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere. "This can't go on," I thought I heard him say. "Either he must listen to reason, or I'll have to use the last resort of civilization." Then, speaking to me in a louder voice, he quickly said, "Listen: no stranger can witness what you've witnessed. Send your Wife away immediately, before she comes in. The Gospel of Three Dimensions mustn't be stopped like this. We can't throw away the results of a thousand years of waiting. I hear her coming. Back! Back! Get away from me, or you'll have to come with me – you don't know where – into the Land of Three Dimensions!"
</p>

<p>
"Fool! Madman! Troublemaker!" I shouted. "I'll never let you go. You'll pay for your tricks."
</p>

<p>
"Has it come to this?" thundered the Stranger. "Then face your fate: you're leaving your Plane. Once, twice, thrice! It's done!"
</p>


<h2>Chapter 18: My Journey to Spaceland and What I Discovered There</h2>

<p>
An indescribable horror came over me. Everything went dark, and then I had a strange, nauseating sensation that wasn't quite like seeing. What I saw wasn't a normal line or space - it was something entirely different. I felt like I was myself, but also not myself. When I finally found my voice, I screamed in agony, "This must be madness or maybe hell!"
</p>

<p>
"It's neither," the Sphere calmly replied. "This is knowledge. This is the Third Dimension. Open your eye once more and try to look steadily."
</p>

<p>
I looked, and wow - a whole new world appeared! Right in front of me was everything I had previously only guessed at or dreamed about - the perfect, beautiful Circular shape in all its glory. I could see what seemed to be the center of the Sphere's body, but I couldn't make out any internal organs. All I saw was a beautiful, harmonious something that I didn't have words to describe. But you, my readers in the 3D world, would call it the surface of the Sphere.
</p>

<p>
Mentally bowing before my guide, I exclaimed, "How is it, O divine ideal of perfect beauty and wisdom, that I can see inside you, yet I can't see your heart, lungs, or other organs?"
</p>

<p>
"What you think you see, you don't actually see," he replied. "You're not able to see my internal parts, nor is any other being. I'm different from the creatures in Flatland. If I were a Circle, you'd be able to see my insides, but I'm a being made up of many Circles - the Many in the One, which in this country is called a Sphere. Just like the outside of a Cube looks like a Square, the outside of a Sphere looks like a Circle."
</p>

<p>
Though I was confused by my Teacher's mysterious words, I no longer argued against them. Instead, I silently worshipped him. He continued, speaking more gently, "Don't worry if you can't immediately understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland. You'll gradually start to get it. Let's begin by looking back at where you came from. Come with me for a bit to the plains of Flatland, and I'll show you something you've often thought about but never actually seen with your own eyes - a visible angle."
</p>

<p>
"That's impossible!" I cried. But the Sphere led the way, and I followed as if in a dream. Suddenly, his voice stopped me: "Look over there and see your own Pentagon-shaped house and everyone inside it."
</p>

<p>
I looked down and saw with my physical eye all the domestic details I had previously only imagined. It was so much clearer and more real than what I had pictured in my mind! I could see my four Sons peacefully sleeping in the northwestern rooms, my two orphaned Grandsons to the south, the Servants, the Butler, and my Daughter, all in their separate rooms. Only my loving Wife, worried about where I was, had left her room and was pacing anxiously in the Hall, waiting for me to return. Even the Page, woken up by my shouts, had left his room and was sneakily looking through the cabinet in my study, pretending to check if I had fainted somewhere.
</p>

<p>
I could see all of this now, not just guess at it. As we got closer and closer, I could even make out what was inside my cabinet - the two chests of gold and the tablets the Sphere had mentioned.
</p>

<center>

</figure>
</center>

<p>
I was moved by how worried my wife was, and I wanted to jump down to comfort her. But I found I couldn't move at all.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry about your wife," my Guide said. "She won't be anxious for long. For now, let's take a look around Flatland."
</p>

<p>
Once again, I felt myself rising through space. The Sphere had been right. The further we moved away from what we were looking at, the more we could see. My hometown, with the inside of every house and every person in it, was laid out below us like a miniature model. We went higher, and suddenly I could see things I'd never imagined - the secrets hidden underground, deep mines, and the innermost parts of hills were all visible to me.
</p>

<p>
I was amazed at seeing these hidden parts of the earth that had just been revealed to my unworthy eyes. I said to my companion, "Look at me now - I've become like a god. The wise men in our country say that to see everything - what they call 'omnividence' - is something only God can do."
</p>

<p>
There was a hint of scorn in my Teacher's voice as he replied, "Is that so? Well, then, according to your wise men, even the pickpockets and murderers in my country should be worshipped as gods. Every single one of them can see as much as you can right now. But trust me, your wise men are wrong."
</p>

<p>
I asked, "So, can others besides gods see everything?"
</p>

<p>
The Sphere answered, "I'm not sure. But just because a thief or a murderer from our country can see everything in your country, that doesn't mean you should think of them as a god. This ability to see everything - 'omnividence' as you call it (though that's not a common word in Spaceland) - does it make you more fair? More kind? Less selfish? More loving? Not at all. So how does it make you more godlike?"
</p>

<p>
I protested, "More kind, more loving? But those are qualities we associate with women! We know that a Circle is a higher being than a Straight Line because knowledge and wisdom are more valuable than mere feelings."
</p>

<p>
The Sphere responded, "It's not for me to rank human qualities. But many of the best and wisest people in Spaceland value emotions more than intellect, and think more highly of your despised Straight Lines than of your praised Circles. But enough of this. Look over there. Do you recognize that building?"
</p>

<p>
I looked and saw, far away, an enormous structure with many sides. I realized it was the General Assembly Hall of the States of Flatland. It was surrounded by dense lines of five-sided buildings at right angles to each other, which I knew were streets. I realized we were approaching the great capital city.
</p>

<p>
"We're going down now," said my Guide.
</p>


<p>
It was morning, the first hour of the first day of the year 2000 in our calendar. As they always do, following tradition, the highest-ranking Circles in the land were meeting in a formal gathering. They met like this on the first hour of the first day of the year 1000, and also on the first hour of the first day of the year 0.
</p>

<p>
Someone I immediately recognized as my brother, a perfectly symmetrical Square and the Chief Clerk of the High Council, was reading the minutes of the previous meetings. The records showed that on each occasion, they had decided:
</p>

<p>
"There have been troublemakers claiming to have received messages from another world. These people have been driving themselves and others crazy with their so-called 'proofs.' Because of this, the Grand Council has unanimously decided that on the first day of each new millennium, special orders will be sent to the local authorities in all parts of Flatland. They must search carefully for these misguided individuals. Without any formal mathematical examination, they are to destroy any Isosceles of any degree, punish any regular Triangle, send any Square or Pentagon to the district mental hospital, and arrest anyone of higher rank, sending them straight to the capital to be judged by the Council."
</p>

<p>
"You hear what's in store for you," the Sphere said to me, as the Council passed this formal decision for the third time. "Death or imprisonment awaits anyone who spreads the message of the Third Dimension."
</p>

<p>
"That's not true," I replied. "The concept of real space is so clear to me now, so obvious, that I think I could explain it even to a child. Please, let me go down there right now and enlighten them."
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said my guide. "The time for that will come. For now, I have my own task to complete. Stay where you are."
</p>

<p>
With these words, he jumped skillfully into what I might call the 'sea' of Flatland, right in the middle of the ring of Counsellors.
</p>

<p>
"I've come to announce that there is a land of Three Dimensions," he declared.
</p>


<p>
I noticed that many of the younger Council members jumped back, clearly shocked, as the Sphere's circular cross-section grew larger before them. But the head Circle, who showed no fear or surprise at all, made a signal. Immediately, six low-ranking Isosceles Triangles from different parts of the room rushed at the Sphere.
</p>

<p>
"We've got him!" they shouted. "No... wait... yes, we still have him! He's slipping away! He's gone!"
</p>

<p>
The President spoke to the junior Circles of the Council, "There's absolutely no need to be surprised. The secret records, which only I can access, tell me that this same thing happened at the last two millennium celebrations. Of course, you won't mention any of this outside the Cabinet."
</p>

<p>
Raising his voice, he then called for the guards. "Arrest the policemen and gag them. You know what to do."
</p>

<p>
After he had sent the unfortunate policemen - unwilling witnesses to a state secret they weren't allowed to reveal - to their fate, he addressed the Council members again.
</p>

<p>
"My Lords, now that the Council's business is finished, I just want to wish you a Happy New Year."
</p>

<p>
Before leaving, he spoke at length to the Clerk - my excellent but very unlucky brother. He expressed his sincere regret that, following tradition and for the sake of secrecy, he had to sentence my brother to life in prison. However, he added that he was pleased that, as long as my brother didn't mention anything about what had happened that day, his life would be spared.
</p>



<h2>Chapter 19: How the Sphere Showed Me Other Mysteries of Spaceland, and What Came of It</h2>

<p>
When I saw my poor brother being led away to prison, I tried to jump down into the Council Chamber. I wanted to speak up for him, or at least say goodbye. But I found I couldn't move on my own. I was completely dependent on what my Guide, the Sphere, wanted to do. He said in a gloomy voice, "Don't worry about your brother. You'll probably have plenty of time later to feel sorry for him. Follow me."
</p>

<p>
Once again, we floated up into space. The Sphere said, "So far, I've only shown you flat shapes and what's inside them. Now I need to introduce you to solid objects and show you how they're built. Look at this bunch of movable square cards. Watch, I'm putting one on top of another, not next to it like you might expect. Now another, and another. See, I'm building up a solid shape by stacking lots of squares on top of each other. Now the solid is complete. It's as tall as it is long and wide, and we call it a Cube."
</p>

<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/img10.jpg" />
</figure>
</center>

<p>
"I'm sorry, sir," I replied, "but to me, it looks like an irregular shape that's been cut open. In other words, I don't see a solid object, but a flat shape like we have in Flatland. It looks so strange that it's almost painful to look at."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," said the Sphere. "It looks flat to you because you're not used to light, shadow, and perspective. It's like how in Flatland, a hexagon would look like a straight line to someone who couldn't recognize different shapes by sight. But it really is a solid object, as you'll learn when you touch it."
</p>

<p>
He then introduced me to the Cube. I found that this amazing thing wasn't flat at all, but truly solid. It had six flat sides and eight corner points called solid angles. I remembered what the Sphere had said about how a square moving in Space, parallel to itself, would create something like this. I was happy to think that such an unimportant creature as myself could, in a way, be seen as the ancestor of such an impressive offspring.
</p>

<p>
But I still couldn't fully understand what my Teacher had told me about "light," "shadow," and "perspective." I didn't hesitate to ask him about these things I didn't understand.
</p>

<p>
If I were to repeat the Sphere's explanation of these matters, clear and brief as it was, it would be boring for someone from Space, who already knows these things. Let's just say that by clearly explaining things, changing the position of objects and lights, and letting me touch various objects and even his own sacred Person, he finally made everything clear to me. Now I could easily tell the difference between a Circle and a Sphere, a flat shape and a solid object.
</p>

<p>
This was the high point, the absolute best part, of my strange and eventful story. From here on, I have to tell you about my miserable downfall. It was a terrible fall, and totally undeserved! Why should the thirst for knowledge be encouraged, only to be disappointed and punished? I don't want to remember how humiliated I felt, but like a second Prometheus, I'll endure this and worse if I can somehow inspire people in Flatland and Spaceland to rebel against the idea that we're limited to two or three dimensions, or any number less than infinity.
</p>

<p>
So, I'll put aside my personal feelings! I'll continue to the end as I began, without going off topic or jumping ahead. I'll stick to telling the story without emotion. I'll write down the exact facts and words – they're burned into my memory – without changing a thing. Let my Readers judge between me and Fate.
</p>


<p>
The Sphere was happy to keep teaching me about the shapes of all regular solids: cylinders, cones, pyramids, and other complex shapes with many sides, all the way up to spheres. But I decided to interrupt him. It wasn't because I was tired of learning. Actually, I was eager to learn even more than what he was offering.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me," I said, "I know I shouldn't call you 'the most beautiful being' anymore. But please, can I see what's inside you?"
</p>

<p>
Sphere: "My what?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "Your insides. Your stomach, your organs."
</p>

<p>
Sphere: "Why are you asking such a rude question? And what do you mean by saying I'm not the most beautiful being anymore?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "Sir, you've taught me to aim for something even greater, more beautiful, and closer to perfection than you. Just as you, being better than all shapes in Flatland, combine many circles into one, surely there must be a being above you who combines many spheres into one supreme existence, even more amazing than the solids in Spaceland. And just as we in Space can now look down on Flatland and see inside everything, there must be an even higher, purer place above us. I'm sure you're planning to take me there. O, you who I'll always call my teacher, philosopher, and friend, no matter where we are – there must be an even more spacious Space, a world with even more dimensions. From there, we'll be able to look down and see inside solid things, and we'll see your insides and those of other spheres. This would be amazing for a poor exile from Flatland like me, who has already learned so much."
</p>

<p>
Sphere: "Nonsense! Enough of this silly talk! We don't have much time, and there's still a lot to do before you're ready to spread the word about Three Dimensions to your short-sighted countrymen in Flatland."
</p>

<p>
Me: "Please, kind teacher, don't refuse me something I know you can do. Just let me have one glimpse of your insides, and I'll be satisfied forever. I'll be your obedient student, your loyal follower, ready to learn everything you teach me."
</p>

<p>
Sphere: "Well, to satisfy you and make you be quiet, let me say this: I would show you if I could, but I can't. Do you want me to turn my stomach inside out just to please you?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "But sir, you've shown me the insides of everyone in the Two-Dimensional world by taking me to the Three-Dimensional world. So, it should be easy for you to take me on another journey to the wonderful Four-Dimensional world. There, I could look down with you once more on the Three-Dimensional land and see inside every three-dimensional house, the secrets hidden in the earth, the treasures in Spaceland's mines, and the insides of every solid creature, even the noble and adorable Spheres."
</p>

<p>
Sphere: "But where is this Four-Dimensional land?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "I don't know, but surely you, my teacher, know."
</p>

<p>
Sphere: "There is no such land. The very idea of it is impossible to imagine."
</p>

<p>
Me: "Not impossible for me to imagine, and surely even less impossible for you to understand. In fact, I believe that even here in this Three-Dimensional region, you could use your skills to make the Fourth Dimension visible to me. After all, in the Two-Dimensional land, you tried to open the eyes of your blind student to the invisible presence of a Third Dimension, even though I couldn't see it then."
</p>


<p>
"Let me think back to what happened before. When I was in Flatland, didn't someone teach me that when I saw a Line and figured out it was part of a Plane, I was actually seeing a third dimension I didn't recognize? This dimension wasn't brightness, but was called 'height'? And doesn't it make sense that here in this three-dimensional world, when I see a Plane and figure out it's part of a Solid, I'm actually seeing a fourth dimension? We can't measure this dimension, just like we couldn't measure height in Flatland, but it must exist, right?
</p>

<p>
And there's more evidence if we look at how shapes work in different dimensions.
</p>

<p>
The Sphere interrupted, "Evidence? What evidence are you talking about?"
</p>

<p>
I replied, "Your Lordship is testing me to see if I remember what you taught me. Don't play games with me, sir. I'm desperate for more knowledge. Surely you can't deny that a Point, when moved, creates a Line with two endpoints? And that a Line, when moved sideways, creates a Square with four corners? You taught me this yourself. Or have you forgotten what you explained to me?
</p>

<p>
In one dimension, when a Point moves, doesn't it make a Line with two endpoints?
</p>

<p>
In two dimensions, when a Line moves, doesn't it make a Square with four corners?
</p>

<p>
In three dimensions, when a Square moves, didn't I see with my own eyes that it created a Cube with eight corners?
</p>

<p>
So, in four dimensions, when a Cube moves - and I'm sorry if this goes against what we usually think - won't it create an even more amazing shape with sixteen corners?
</p>

<p>
Look at the pattern: 2, 4, 8, 16. Isn't this a geometric sequence? Isn't this exactly what you'd call 'following the rules of similarity'?
</p>

<p>
Also, didn't you teach me that just as a Line has two endpoints, and a Square has four sides, a Cube must have six faces? Look at this sequence too: 2, 4, 6. Isn't this an arithmetic sequence? So, doesn't it make sense that the even more incredible shape that comes from a Cube in the four-dimensional world must have 8 cubic sides? Isn't this also, as you taught me, 'following the rules of similarity'?
</p>

<p>
Oh, my Lord, my Lord, I'm making guesses here because I don't know all the facts. I'm asking you to tell me if I'm right or wrong in my logical thinking. If I'm wrong, I'll give up and stop asking about a Fourth Dimension. But if I'm right, please listen to what makes sense."
</p>

<p>
"So I'm asking: Is it true or not that your people have seen higher-dimensional beings appear in your world? These beings enter closed rooms without opening doors or windows, show up and disappear at will? If you say no, I'm ready to give up arguing. Just give me an answer."
</p>

<p>
The Sphere was quiet for a moment, then said, "People say it's happened. But there's a lot of disagreement about the facts. Even if we accept that it did happen, people explain it in different ways. But here's the thing: no matter how many explanations there are, no one has ever suggested the idea of a Fourth Dimension. So please, stop this nonsense, and let's get back to the real issues."
</p>

<p>
"I knew it!" I exclaimed. "I was sure my guess would be right. And now, please be patient with me and answer one more question, my excellent Teacher! Those who have appeared - no one knows where they came from - and then vanished - no one knows where to - have they also shrunk and disappeared somehow into that more spacious Space, where I'm now begging you to take me?"
</p>

<p>
The Sphere replied in a gloomy tone, "They've vanished, for sure - if they ever really appeared. But most people think these visions came from the mind - you won't understand this - from the brain. They say it's because of the disturbed perceptions of the person who saw them."
</p>

<p>
"Say it isn't so!" I cried. "Don't believe them. Or if it really is true that this other Space is actually the land of Thought, then take me to that blessed region where I can see inside all solid things. There, before my amazed eyes, a Cube will move in a completely new direction, but still following the rules, so that every part of its insides will pass through a new kind of Space. It'll create an even more perfect shape than itself, with sixteen corners and Eight solid Cubes as its outline. And once we're there, shall we stop our upward journey? In that wonderful region of Four Dimensions, won't we look to the threshold of the Fifth, and not enter? Ah, no! Let's keep going, pushing our mental boundaries higher. Then, giving in to our intellectual drive, the gates of the Sixth Dimension will open wide. After that, a Seventh, and then an Eighth—"
</p>

<p>
I don't know how long I would have continued if the Sphere hadn't interrupted me, despite his thunderous commands for silence and threats of terrible punishments if I kept talking. Nothing could stop the flood of my excited aspirations. Maybe I was to blame, but honestly, I was drunk on the recent doses of Truth he had given me. I couldn't help myself. However, the end came quickly. My words were cut short by a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside me, which sent me flying through space with a speed that made speech impossible. Down! Down! I was rapidly descending, and I knew that return to Flatland was my fate. One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten glimpse I had of that dull level wilderness - which was now to become my Universe again - spread out before my eye. Then a darkness. Then a final, all-encompassing thunder-peal; and when I came to myself, I was once again a common creeping Square, in my study at home, listening to the Peace-Cry of my approaching Wife.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 20: How the Sphere Encouraged Me in a Dream</h2>

<p>
Even though I had less than a minute to think, I instinctively knew I had to hide what happened from my wife. It wasn't that I was worried she'd tell anyone my secret. I just knew that, as a woman in Flatland, she wouldn't be able to understand my adventures.
</p>

<p>
So I made up a story on the spot. I told her I had accidentally fallen through the cellar's trapdoor and been knocked out.
</p>

<p>
In our country, the pull towards the South is so weak that even for a woman, my story seemed pretty unbelievable. But my wife, who's much smarter than most women, could tell I was really worked up about something. She didn't argue with me. Instead, she insisted I was sick and needed to rest.
</p>

<p>
I was glad for an excuse to go to my room and think quietly about what had happened. When I was finally alone, I started feeling sleepy. But before I closed my eyes, I tried to picture the Third Dimension in my mind, especially how a cube is made by moving a square. It wasn't as clear as I wanted it to be. But I remembered that the key was to think "Upward, but not Northward." I was determined to keep these words in my mind as a clue that would lead me to the answer. So, like a magic spell, I kept repeating "Upward, but not Northward" until I fell into a deep sleep.
</p>

<p>
While I was sleeping, I had a dream. I thought I was once again with the Sphere, who was now glowing brightly, showing he wasn't angry with me anymore. We were moving together towards a tiny, bright dot. The Sphere pointed it out to me. As we got closer, I thought I heard a faint humming noise coming from it, like a very quiet version of the buzzing you might hear from a fly in your world. The sound was so soft that even in the total silence of the empty space we were floating through, we couldn't hear it until we stopped moving when we were about twenty human diagonals away from it.
</p>

<p>
"Look over there," said my guide. "You've lived in Flatland, you've seen Lineland, and you've soared with me to the heights of Spaceland. Now, to complete your experience, I'm taking you down to the lowest level of existence - to Pointland, the Abyss of No Dimensions."
</p>

<p>
"See that miserable creature? That Point is a being like us, but it's trapped in a world with no dimensions at all. It is its own world, its own universe. It can't even imagine anything other than itself. It doesn't know about length, width, or height because it's never experienced them. It can't even understand the concept of 'two' - it has no idea what 'more than one' means. To this Point, it is everything that exists, even though it's really nothing at all."
</p>

<p>
"Look at how perfectly happy it is with itself," the Sphere continued. "Learn this lesson from it: being content with yourself when you know nothing is a terrible thing. It's better to want to learn and grow, even if it's difficult, than to be blindly and stupidly happy."
</p>

<p>
"Now, listen," he said.
</p>

<p>
The Sphere stopped talking, and I heard a tiny, low, monotonous sound coming from the little buzzing creature. It sounded like one of your world's voice recorders, and I could make out these words: "Infinite happiness of existence! It is; and there is nothing else besides It."
</p>

<p>
"What does the tiny creature mean by 'it'?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"It means itself," said the Sphere. "Haven't you noticed before how babies and simple-minded people who can't tell the difference between themselves and the world around them often talk about themselves as if they were someone else?"
</p>

<p>
"But be quiet and listen," he added.
</p>

<p>
The little creature kept talking to itself: "It fills all of Space, and what It fills, It is. What It thinks, It says out loud. What It says, It hears. It is the Thinker, the Speaker, the Hearer, the Thought, the Word, and the Sound. It is the One, and yet It is All in All. Oh, the happiness, the happiness of Being!"
</p>

<p>
"Can't you shock the little thing out of its self-satisfaction?" I asked. "Tell it what it really is, like you told me. Show it how limited Pointland is, and inspire it to aim for something higher."
</p>

<p>
"That's not an easy task," said my teacher. "Why don't you try?"
</p>

<p>
So, raising my voice as loud as I could, I addressed the Point:
</p>

<p>
"Silence, you pitiful creature. You call yourself the All in All, but you are Nothing. Your so-called Universe is just a tiny speck in a Line, and a Line is just a shadow compared to—"
</p>

<p>
"Shh, that's enough," the Sphere interrupted. "Now, watch how the King of Pointland reacts to your speech."
</p>

<p>
The Point glowed even brighter when it heard my words, showing it was still perfectly happy with itself. I had barely finished speaking when it started talking again.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the joy, the joy of Thought! What can It not achieve by thinking! Its own Thought coming to Itself, suggesting Its imperfection, only to enhance Its happiness! Sweet rebellion stirred up to end in triumph! Ah, the divine creative power of the All in One! Ah, the joy, the joy of Being!"
</p>

<p>
"You see," said my teacher, "how little effect your words have had. As far as the monarch understands them at all, it thinks they are its own thoughts. It can't imagine any other being besides itself. It's proud of the variety of 'Its Thought' and sees it as proof of its creative power. Let's leave this God of Pointland to enjoy its ignorant self-satisfaction. Nothing you or I can do will free it from its self-obsession."
</p>

<p>
After this, as we gently floated back to Flatland, I could hear my companion's calm voice explaining the moral of my vision and encouraging me to aspire to greater things and to teach others to do the same. He admitted that at first, he had been angry at my ambition to understand dimensions beyond the Third. But since then, he had gained new insight and wasn't too proud to admit his mistake to a student.
</p>

<p>
Then he began to teach me even higher mysteries than those I had seen before. He showed me how to create Extra-Solids by moving Solids, and Double Extra-Solids by moving Extra-Solids. All of this was "strictly according to analogy," using methods so simple and easy that even women could understand them.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 21: How I Tried to Teach the Theory of Three Dimensions to My Grandson, and What Happened</h2>

<p>
I woke up feeling excited and started thinking about the amazing opportunities ahead of me. I was determined to spread the word about the Third Dimension throughout Flatland. I decided I would start by telling my wife.
</p>

<p>
Just as I was planning what to do, I heard people in the street calling for silence. Then a louder voice spoke - it was an official announcement. I listened carefully and realized it was the Council's decision. They were ordering the arrest, imprisonment, or execution of anyone who tried to mislead people with false ideas or claimed to have received messages from another world.
</p>

<p>
I thought about this for a while. It was clearly too dangerous to ignore. I decided it would be safer to avoid mentioning my experience in the Third Dimension. Instead, I would try to prove it through logic and reasoning. After all, the idea seemed so simple and clear - "Upward, not Northward" was the key to understanding it all. It had seemed obvious to me before I fell asleep, and when I first woke up, it was as clear as basic math. But now, it didn't seem quite so simple.
</p>

<p>
Even though my wife came into the room at that moment, I decided not to start explaining it to her after we exchanged a few casual words.
</p>

<p>
My sons, who were respected doctors, weren't great at math and wouldn't be suitable for what I had in mind. But then I thought of my young, intelligent grandson who was good with numbers. I remembered how he had impressed me earlier with his thoughts about what 3³ might mean. I figured it would be safe to start with him since he was just a child and wouldn't know about the Council's announcement. If I talked about controversial topics with my sons, I couldn't be sure they wouldn't report me to the authorities out of a sense of duty, despite their love for me.
</p>

<p>
But first, I had to come up with a story to explain to my wife why the Circle had wanted to meet with me and how he had entered our house. I won't go into the details of the elaborate tale I told her, but let's just say it wasn't entirely truthful. In the end, I managed to convince her to go back to her household duties without mentioning anything about the World of Three Dimensions.
</p>

<p>
With that taken care of, I immediately sent for my grandson. To be honest, everything I had seen and heard was starting to feel like a fading dream, and I was eager to try teaching someone else about it.
</p>

<p>
When my grandson entered the room, I carefully closed the door. Then, sitting next to him with our math tools, I said we'd continue yesterday's lesson. I showed him again how a Point moving in One Dimension creates a Line, and how a Line moving in Two Dimensions creates a Square. Then, trying to sound casual, I said, "Now, you little rascal, you were trying to convince me that a Square could somehow move 'Upward, not Northward' and create another shape, a kind of extra square in Three Dimensions. Let's hear that idea again."
</p>

<p>
Just then, we heard the official announcement being repeated outside in the street. Even though he was young, my grandson - who was unusually smart for his age and had been taught to always respect the Circles - understood what was happening faster than I expected. He waited until the announcement finished, then burst into tears and said, "Grandpa, I was only joking earlier. Of course I didn't mean anything by it. We didn't know about the new law then, and I don't think I said anything about a Third Dimension. I'm sure I never said 'Upward, not Northward' because that doesn't make any sense. How could something move Upward and not Northward? That's just silly. Even a baby wouldn't say something so ridiculous. It's so funny! Ha ha ha!"
</p>

<p>
"It's not silly at all," I said, starting to lose my temper. "Look, I'll show you. Here's a Square," I said, picking up a movable Square that was nearby. "Now I'm moving it, not Northward but... yes, I'm moving it Upward. Well, not exactly like this, but somehow..." I trailed off, waving the Square around aimlessly, which only made my grandson laugh even harder.
</p>

<p>
He said I wasn't teaching him anything, just playing around. Then he unlocked the door and ran out of the room. And that's how my first attempt to teach someone about the Third Dimension ended in failure.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 22: How I Tried to Spread the Theory of Three Dimensions Using Different Methods, and What Happened</h2>

<p>
My failure with my grandson didn't discourage me from sharing my secret with others in my household. But it did teach me that I couldn't rely solely on the phrase "Upward, not Northward." I realized I needed to give people a clearer picture of the whole concept. To do this, I decided I had to write it down.
</p>

<p>
So, I spent several months in private, writing a book about the mysteries of Three Dimensions. To try to avoid breaking the law, I didn't talk about a physical Dimension. Instead, I described a "Thoughtland" - a place where, in theory, a shape could look down on Flatland and see inside everything at once. In this place, there might even be a shape surrounded by six squares and with eight corner points.
</p>

<p>
But as I was writing, I ran into a big problem. In our country of Flatland, we don't have any writing surfaces except Lines. We don't have any diagrams except Lines, all in one straight line, only distinguishable by how big or bright they are. So when I finished my book (which I called "Through Flatland to Thoughtland"), I wasn't sure if many people would understand what I meant.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, my wife was feeling down. I lost interest in all the things I used to enjoy. Everything I saw tempted me to speak out about what I knew, because I couldn't compare what I saw in Two Dimensions with what it really was in Three Dimensions. It was hard not to make these comparisons out loud.
</p>

<p>
I neglected my clients and my own work, spending all my time thinking about the mysteries I had seen but couldn't share with anyone. Every day, it got harder to remember exactly what I had experienced. One day, about eleven months after I returned from Spaceland, I tried to picture a Cube with my eyes closed, but I couldn't do it. Even though I managed to do it later, I was never quite sure if I was remembering it correctly. This made me even more depressed than before, and I decided I had to do something, but I didn't know what.
</p>

<p>
I felt like I would have given my life for the cause if it meant I could convince people. But if I couldn't even convince my own grandson, how could I hope to convince the highest and most developed Circles in the land?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes my feelings were too strong to keep inside, and I would say things that could get me in trouble. People already thought I had strange ideas, maybe even dangerous ones. I knew I was in a risky situation, but sometimes I couldn't stop myself from saying suspicious things, even when I was with high-ranking Polygons or Circles.
</p>

<p>
For example, when people were discussing how to deal with those who claimed they could see inside things, I would quote an old Circle who said that most people always think prophets and visionaries are crazy. I sometimes used phrases like "the eye that sees inside things" and "the all-seeing land." Once or twice, I even used the forbidden terms "Third and Fourth Dimensions."
</p>

<p>
Finally, I made a big mistake. At a meeting of our local discussion group, held at the Prefect's own house, someone read a long paper explaining why Providence had limited the number of Dimensions to Two, and why only the Supreme Being could see everything. I forgot myself and gave a detailed account of my whole journey with the Sphere into Space, to the Assembly Hall in our capital, then back to Space, and finally my return home. I told them everything I had seen and heard, both real and in visions.
</p>

<p>
At first, I pretended I was describing the imaginary experiences of a made-up person. But I got so excited that I soon dropped the act. In the end, I passionately urged everyone listening to forget their preconceptions and believe in the Third Dimension.
</p>

<p>
You can probably guess what happened next - I was immediately arrested and taken before the Council.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, I found myself standing in the very spot where the Sphere had stood with me just a few months earlier. I was allowed to tell my story without interruption. But from the start, I knew what was going to happen. The President noticed that there were high-ranking Policemen on guard, with angles of nearly 55°. He ordered them to be replaced by lower-ranking ones of 2° or 3°. I knew all too well what this meant.
</p>

<p>
I was going to be executed or imprisoned, and my story was going to be kept secret by getting rid of the officials who had heard it. Since this was the plan, the President wanted to use cheaper victims instead of more expensive ones.
</p>

<p>
After I finished explaining myself, the President - maybe noticing that some of the younger Circles seemed moved by how sincere I was - asked me two questions:
</p>

<p>
1. Could I show the direction I meant when I said "Upward, not Northward"?
</p>

<p>
2. Could I use any diagrams or descriptions (other than just listing imaginary sides and angles) to show the shape I was calling a Cube?
</p>

<p>
I said I couldn't say anything more, and that I had to trust in the Truth, which would surely win in the end.
</p>

<p>
The President agreed with my sentiment and said I couldn't do better. He said I would be sentenced to life in prison. But if the Truth wanted me to get out of prison and spread the message to the world, then the Truth could make that happen. In the meantime, I wouldn't be made uncomfortable except for what was necessary to keep me from escaping. Unless I misbehaved, I would occasionally be allowed to see my brother, who was already in prison.
</p>

<p>
Seven years have passed, and I'm still a prisoner. Except for occasional visits from my brother, I'm not allowed to have any companions other than my jailers. My brother is one of the best Squares - fair, sensible, cheerful, and caring about his family. But I have to admit that our weekly meetings cause me a lot of pain in one way.
</p>

<p>
He was there when the Sphere appeared in the Council Chamber. He saw the Sphere's changing cross-sections. He heard the explanation given to the Circles about what was happening. For the past seven years, almost every week, he has heard me repeat the story of my part in that event. I've described all the phenomena in Spaceland and explained the arguments for the existence of Solid things based on Analogy. Yet - I'm ashamed to admit - my brother still hasn't understood the nature of Three Dimensions. He openly says he doesn't believe a Sphere exists.
</p>

<p>
So, I have no converts at all. As far as I can tell, this world-changing revelation has been given to me for nothing. In the myth, Prometheus was punished for bringing fire to humans. But I - a Flatland Prometheus - am locked up here for bringing nothing to my countrymen.
</p>

<p>
Still, I hold onto the hope that these memoirs will somehow find their way to the minds of humanity in Some Dimension, and might inspire a group of rebels who refuse to be limited to a set number of Dimensions.
</p>

<p>
That's what I hope for in my brighter moments. But it's not always like that. Sometimes, I'm weighed down by the troubling thought that I can't even be sure of the exact shape of the Cube I once saw and now miss so much. In my dreams at night, the mysterious instruction "Upward, not Northward" haunts me like a riddle I can't solve.
</p>

<p>
It's part of the suffering I endure for the sake of Truth that there are times when my mind is weak. At these times, Cubes and Spheres seem to fade away into things that might not even exist. The Land of Three Dimensions starts to feel almost as unreal as the Land of One or No Dimensions. Even this solid wall that keeps me from freedom, these very tablets I'm writing on, and all the solid realities of Flatland itself, seem like nothing more than products of a troubled imagination or the flimsy fabric of a dream.

<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND REVISED EDITION, 1884. BY THE EDITOR</h2>
</center>



<p>
If my friend from Flatland still had the mental strength he had when he started writing these Memoirs, I wouldn't need to write this preface for him. In it, he wants to do three things:
</p>

<p>
First, he wants to thank his readers and critics in Spaceland. They liked his work so much that a second edition was quickly needed.
</p>

<p>
Second, he wants to apologize for some mistakes and typos (though he's not entirely to blame for these).
</p>

<p>
Third, he wants to clear up a couple of misunderstandings.
</p>

<p>
But he's not the same Square he used to be. Years in prison, plus the heavy burden of people generally not believing him and making fun of him, have taken their toll. This, combined with the ideas, concepts, and even some of the language he picked up during his short visit to Spaceland, have changed him. So, he's asked me to respond on his behalf to two specific objections – one intellectual, one moral.
</p>

<p>
The first objection goes like this: When someone from Flatland sees a Line, they must see something that has both length and some thickness (otherwise it wouldn't be visible). So, the argument goes, they should realize that their fellow Flatlanders aren't just long and wide, but also (even if just a tiny bit) thick or tall.
</p>

<p>
This argument seems convincing, especially to those of us in Spaceland. It's so persuasive that when I first heard it, I didn't know how to respond. But my old friend's answer seems to completely address it.
</p>

<p>
"I agree," he said when I mentioned this objection to him, "that what your critic is saying is factually correct. But I disagree with their conclusions. It's true that in Flatland we actually have a third, unrecognized dimension called 'height,' just like you in Spaceland actually have a fourth, unnamed dimension that I'll call 'extra-height.' But we can no more be aware of our 'height' than you can be of your 'extra-height.' Even I, who've been to Spaceland and had the privilege of understanding what 'height' means for a whole day, can't comprehend it now. I can't see it or understand it through reason. I can only accept it through faith."
</p>

<p>
The reason is clear. When we talk about dimensions, we're talking about directions and measurements - the concepts of "more" and "less." In our world, all our lines are equally and incredibly thin (or tall, whichever way you want to look at it). Because of this, there's nothing about them that could make us think about that extra dimension. Even if we had super precise measuring tools, as one hasty critic from Spaceland suggested, they wouldn't help us. We wouldn't know what to measure or in which direction to measure it.
</p>

<p>
When we see a Line, we see something long and bright. Both length and brightness are necessary for a Line to exist. If the brightness disappears, the Line vanishes. So when I try to explain to my Flatland friends about this extra dimension that's somehow visible in a Line, they say, "Oh, you must mean brightness." And when I reply, "No, I mean a real physical dimension," they challenge me, "Well then, measure it, or tell us which way it goes." This stumps me because I can't do either.
</p>

<p>
Just yesterday, when the Chief Circle (that's what we call our High Priest) came to check on the State Prison and paid me his yearly visit for the seventh time, he asked me again, "Are you any better?" I tried to prove to him that he was "tall" as well as long and wide, even though he didn't realize it. But how did he respond? He said, "You say I'm 'tall' - well, measure my 'tallness' and I'll believe you." What could I do? How could I meet his challenge? I was completely defeated, and he left the room feeling triumphant.
</p>

<p>
Does this still seem strange to you? Then try to put yourself in a similar situation. Imagine a being from the Fourth Dimension came to visit you and said, "Every time you open your eyes, you see a Plane (which has two dimensions) and you figure out that it's part of a Solid (which has three dimensions). But what you don't realize is that you're also seeing a Fourth Dimension. It's not color or brightness or anything like that, but a real dimension. I can't point out which direction it's in, and you can't possibly measure it." What would you say to a visitor like that? Wouldn't you want to have them locked up? Well, that's what's happening to me. It's just as natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for talking about a Third Dimension as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube for talking about a Fourth Dimension.
</p>

<p>
It's sad how alike blind and persecuting humanity is across all dimensions! Whether we're talking about Points, Lines, Squares, Cubes, or Extra-Cubes - we're all prone to the same mistakes. We're all slaves to the prejudices of our own dimensions, as one of our Spaceland poets said: 'One touch of Nature makes all worlds akin.'<sup>[4]</sup>
</p>

<p class="footnote" id="foot4">
[4]: The Author wants me to add that some of his critics have misunderstood this point. Because of this, he has added some comments (on pages 74 and 92) to his conversation with the Sphere. These comments relate to this issue, which he had previously left out because he thought they were boring and unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
The Square's argument on this point seems unbeatable. I wish I could say his response to the second objection (the moral one) was just as clear and convincing. Some have accused him of hating women. This accusation has been strongly pushed by those who, by Nature's decree, make up the slightly larger half of Spaceland's population. I'd like to address this criticism as honestly as I can.
</p>

<p>
But the Square isn't used to discussing moral issues in the way we do in Spaceland. If I directly translated his defense against this accusation, I wouldn't be doing him justice. So, as his interpreter and summarizer, I gather that during his seven years in prison, he has changed his personal views about both Women and the Isosceles (or Lower Classes).
</p>

<p>
Personally, he now tends to agree with the Sphere's opinion (see page 86) that in many important ways, the Straight Lines are better than the Circles. But when writing as a historian, he has closely followed the views generally accepted in Flatland, and (as he's been told) even in Spaceland. In history books (until very recently), the fates of Women and the common people have rarely been considered important enough to mention, let alone carefully consider.
</p>

<p>
In an even less clear part, he now wants to distance himself from the Circle-favoring or aristocratic tendencies that some critics have naturally attributed to him. He recognizes the intellectual power that a few Circles have used for many generations to maintain control over huge numbers of their countrymen. However, he believes that the facts of Flatland, without any commentary from him, show that revolutions can't always be stopped by killing people. He thinks that Nature, by making the Circles unable to have children, has doomed them to eventual failure.
</p>

<p>
"In this," he says, "I see the great Law of all worlds at work. While human wisdom thinks it's doing one thing, Nature's wisdom makes it do something else - something quite different and much better."
</p>

<p>
For the rest, he asks his readers not to assume that every tiny detail of daily life in Flatland must have an exact parallel in Spaceland. Yet he hopes that, taken as a whole, his work might be both thought-provoking and entertaining. He hopes it will appeal to those Spacelanders who are modest and reasonable - those who, when talking about the most important things that lie beyond our experience, refuse to say either "This can never happen," or "It must happen exactly this way, and we know everything about it."
