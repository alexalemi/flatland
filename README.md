This is a "translation" of flatland into contemporary english, powered by
Claude Sonnet 3.5.

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is a novel written by a square who lives
in a 2D world and meets a Sphere that introduces him to the third dimension.
Over the course of the book, the squares mind is blown and as a child, my mind
was similarly blown when I read the book.  The book got me thinking about
geometry and dimensions and inparticular speculating about the fourth dimension
in a way I found profounding eye opening.

I think its a great book, though having originally been written in 1884, the
text is a bit archaic and hard to read.  I think this limits its audience in an
unfortunate way.  So, I thought I'd ask Claude to "translate" the work into
more contemporary english.  I think it went swimmingly.  The new text is easier
to read but is faithful to the original story.

I used the public domain copy of text available from [Project
Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/97/pg97-images.html). Claude
Sonnet 3.5 provided the "translation", and the design of the webpage was
inspired by the design of the wonderful website version of another fantastic
old book [Calculus Made Easy](https://calculusmadeeasy.org/).

If you wish to read the original, I highly recommend the [Standard Ebooks
edition](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edwin-a-abbott/flatland), which
contributes beautiful typography to a beautiful book.

I hope this little project can broaden the reach of one of the most impactful
books I've read.

Enjoy.
